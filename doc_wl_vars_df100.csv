As we have reported, we converted six distributors at the beginning of January 2009 with our distributor converging largely completed our first quarter of 2010 versus 2009 is a clean comparison in terms of growth rate. We are cautiously optimistic that the protocol changes along with our recruiting efforts will enable us to accelerate enrollment. We have filed two of the three modules for our PMA submission for RESPECT and are working with the FDA to move through that process. In this quarter, we successfully achieved two significant milestones for the company, one clinical milestone with FDA approval to begin the clinical trial in the U.S. to evaluate the safety in efficacy of our AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug to close the left atrial appendage and one business milestone with the settlement of our path litigation with Medtronic or to which we will discuss in further detail later in the call. The excess cost of that inventory was amortized to our cost of good, which was completed in May of 2009. When you look at last year, remember that we've repurchased inventory from distributor for our conversation to direct distribution in January of 2009. These risks and uncertainties include market conditions and other factors beyond the company's control and the risk factors of other cautionary statements described in the company's filings with the SEC, including those described in the Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements sections of the company's most recent earnings release as filed on Form 8-K this morning and its annual report on Form 10-K. Direct sales in Europe accounted for 42.3% of net sales and distributors who cover the rest of the world accounted for 18.8% of net sales. The statements made by the company are based upon management's current expectations, and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Our spending was inline with our expectations and our strong gross margins continue to allow us to invest in the pipeline programs which are key to our mission of developing innovative medical devices that can change the status of careful patients. Our distributor sales representing the rest of the world grew 17.9%. The decrease was primarily due to approximately $8 million of cash payment in accordance with our distributor conversion agreement, $5.8 million associated with lower working capital primarily due to payment to employee under the company's annual incentive compensation plan and $2.8 million in higher restricted cash associated with certain litigation appeal. We are very proud of this performance and believe our team can maintain this momentum going forward. Now, let me now turn the call back to John to review some of the operational highlights. In March, 2010, we settled our path litigation with Medtronic relating to the January 2007 patent infringement action brought against us.","John Barr Actually, Larry, I think, when you keep our powder dry in the near-term, I think we want to wait till Occlutech [ph] navigates the approval process with the FDA and again, we don’t want to help our competition in anyway and we will as soon as that happens, we’ll be happy to update you on our, more details on the end points. And on that same topic the flow through on the P&L, since you don’t hedge on the P&L, it’s roughly 40% to 50% of an operating margin hit, could you confirm that? Cash historically for the company has always been sort of, down to neutral in the first quarter because of certain timing and payment, I think also it's the trend of our P&L, we expect just continue to generate positive cash flow from now to the end of the year. As it relates to the hedging, your second part of the question was, what flow-through and what’s you’re talking about is, what’s an offset and I think, we’ve said in the past, our expenses that are non-dollar expenses are roughly 35% to 40% of our non-dollar revenue exposure, so the net exposure there is 40% to 50% - 55% to 60%. To remind you at the time of the IPO, we said that we thought, as - with the end of October, we thought that it would take - again a year to 18 months from that point and that’s again based on statistical models and what we - how we project out enrollment rates. Greece, as I think you may remember is the only country we go through a distributor. And it relates to SG&A probably, as I said we said on our last call, legal fees were down in the quarter, they will continue and that was in power plan but again, for the quarter we came in favorable to that and I think relative to the estimate that was in the $1 million range. I think before you talked about setting of facility in Ireland to potentially substantial do some manufacturing. So we continue to remain as I said optimistic about our potential for growth in the near-term. Larry Biegelsen Wells Fargo So the flow-through would be 55% to 60%, am I understanding that correctly, sorry. So they are not delaying the procedures and it’s somewhat of a cash flow game for them. The second obviously would be nice to have a second facility just in case of disaster purposes and contingency planning but we are going to proceed deliberately and we have no near-term plans to accelerate that process. Just help us understand where you are in the process, timing and just the implications over there? John Barr Actually, we’ve sort of step to took taken a step back Tao and we reevaluating that - as I think we told most of you is that we don’t need the capacity, the great news here is we have a single ship in our Plymouth headquarters manufacturing for the world, so we can more than triple our volume in the initial - and still have a capacity in our facility. We’re working with the FDA to the 510(k) process. From a engineering standpoint, from all the R&D work, we are right on track and we still think we have the same timeline again. And in fact, because several years ago we started a process of putting a dedicated vascular sales force in place, that I think will give them the AVP 4, they are going to just run with it and I think it’s going to be very exciting. Number one is, we've made incentive payments that were payable under our agreement with our distributors, this were the distributors we terminated more then a year ago and that amounted to $8 million. We had - we really track the per unit as much they ship the procedures that are done as much as the shipments and I think we saw growth quarter-to-quarter in both. One is this concept to country of origin, there are number of major countries outside the U.S. where if you have both regulatory approval and you manufacturing the jurisdiction in this case EU. That distributor actually has done a great job for us and continues to actually hit their plan in the first quarter."

We used our well positioned brands to leverage very healthy market conditions and produce strong results in the quarter. The strong global demand for industrial and farm equipment continued to put stress on AGCO's supply chain. Consistent with the market, however, AGCO unit sales of tractors over 100 horsepower and combines both showed strong growth during the first quarter. These documents discuss important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. We also experienced declines in the 40 to 100 horsepower category. Before we get started this morning, let me remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, including some related to future sales, earnings, production levels, supplier and production constraints, farm income, working capital improvement, cash flow, margins effective tax rate, capital expenditure and strategic initiatives. We will be making significant investments in our future in the form of increased engineering expenses to support a growing list of new product programs, costs associated with our European system initiative and spending associated with developing new markets and improving our distribution. As we told you last quarter, we are working with our existing suppliers to prepare them for expected demand levels and we are also working to qualify new suppliers to mitigate future supply constraints. The strong market conditions have at or near capacity in some internal assembly and production operations and we are making investments in some of our facilities to expand capacity. The interest savings were generated by lower debt levels and increased interest income earned in 2008 compared to 2007. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. In Brazil, acreage devoted to corn, soybeans and sugarcane has expanded and crop production is expected to be up from 2007 levels. The South American market continues to respond to strong commodity prices. We will be relying on our sales and margin growth to pay for these investments while generating an improvement in earnings in 2008 compared to 2007. The professional farming segment continues to benefit from higher commodity prices, which contributed to an increase of approximately 30% in the over 100 horsepower tractor segment and growth in the combine market of over 12% in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the $190 million to $200 million range and our free cash flow to remain strong in the $175 million to $200 million range. Tractor and combine production levels were up 25% in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007. Recall that during the first quarter of 2007, our Fendt sales were artificially low as we were initiating production on our new high horsepower series tractors and experienced supply constraints. For the full year of 2008, we expect weakness in tractor under 100 horsepower and strong growth in the high horsepower tractors in the North American industry retail [ph] market. In the first quarter of 2008, we had a relatively normal mix of products whereas the mix in 2007 was weighted more towards mid range and low horsepower tractors due to the initial production of Fendt's new high horse powertractor series as well as supplier constraints at our German plant. On slide 4, you can see our production schedule for 2007 and 2008. Last year, Fendt sales and production were high in the third quarter due to delays experienced in the first six months of 2007, especially for the margin rich high horsepower models. Compared to the first quarter of 2007, we saw improvement across all categories in North America dealer inventory month supply. Operating margins for the first quarter of 2008 were up from 2007 levels due to sales growth, improved product mix in Europe and cost control initiatives, partially offset by currency impacts in North America. Volume growth in our South American business produced operating margins of 10.7% for the first quarter of 2008, up slightly from 2007 despite pressure from currency impacts associated with sales of equipment manufactured in Brazil and exported to other South American markets. In North America, record 2007 farm income is driving strong sales in high horsepower tractor and combines. As Martin mentioned, sales increases in our high horsepower tractors and combines were responsible for much of the growth. The weakest segment continued to be tractors under 40 horsepower that are more closely tied to the general economy. We're projecting 2008 sales to increase 20% to 22%, driven by pricing, healthy market conditions and the positive impact of currency. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we expect to generate strong free cash flow this year. Our seasonal demands for working capital are greater in the first half of the year and thereby generate negative free cash flow in the first quarter of 2008 and 2007. The increased production occurred across all regions with nearly all of our production facilities experiencing double-digit unit growth compared to the first quarter of 2007. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. However, government restrictions on grain export resulted in a disruption in the market late in the quarter that may impact industry demand there in the coming months. At the end of March 2008, our dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was approximately 5 months for tractors, 3.5 months for combines and 6.5 months for hay equipment. Globally, the markets are very healthy and our order books remain ahead of where they stood at this time last year. Slide 5 details industry retail farm equipment volumes by region for the first quarter of 2008.","And we plan to have some or let's say exactly three light assembly operations in U.S. as a first step. Do you put that through on orders that are already in the books and can you do another one just sort of given your orders in the balance of the year, or is it going to be late in the game. And we are now having the best distribution network you could think of in this market. Martin H. Richenhagen Actually, all our high horsepower tractors on wheels, so the conventional tractors are made in factories in Europe and in South America. Last question can you tell us what the average horsepower of the tractor sold in the Central and Eastern Europe market for you is in ballpark terms? Some of the system projects expense that we talked about heavier here in the second quarter which makes as an offset to some of the other benefits that you discussed. We have a new team in charge and we have a very important portfolio specific initiative that will show results soon and that showed or generated already results. So, we're probably being a little cautious there and expect to manage those inventories down throughout the year. The important achievements we so far could generate is that we are in very close contact to key suppliers. So actually you're kind of front end loading those expenses so... Andrew H. Beck That's correct. We've had some issues there, but what appear to be turning the corner with our new distribution strategy in some of the new products that we're introducing. That's a move that we're making in the short term and long term we have another project to look at other moves products as well. That is we're putting that in as a result of the material price increases that are coming on, that we see right now as it primarily relates to steel and steel related components that we have. Martin H. Richenhagen We so far believe that we have the right reserve in place that we are attracting that carefully also doing during the year in order to make sure that we are in good shape. So we're constrained by the currency again. And we continue to see a rising inflation in those components. It seems that sort of bank for the buck as we raised production is not as good as it used to be. Maybe if you could by region and give us a sense of what you are doing with respect to increasing capacity in those regions as well. Martin H. Richenhagen Because of better product, better service, better distribution and we see that also with other brands we own that we differentiate ourselves by our product and not by price. Terry Darling Goldman Sachs Did you have a raw material inflation number in total for us? And so our production in Fendt was significantly higher in the first quarter and that levels off and effectively reverses itself in the third quarter where last year was a bit unusual in terms of the numbers of high horsepower tractors sold and amount of units sold in that third quarter. Then you also mentioned a situation developing in Argentina with the export related issues and could you talk about exactly what's going on down there and what... how that changes the outlook for AG equipment demand? So what offsets there besides [indiscernible] Andrew H. Beck Yes, the offset is primarily currency, as well as higher... some of these initiatives in terms of engineering, higher engineering expense. But you didn't change the [ph] cash flow. A year ago are sales in Fendt in the first quarter were unusually low and even had a very unusual mix in terms of all low and medium horsepower tractors and this year we are back to normal. Andrew H. Beck Ann I think you can try to look at that chart and see that last year the production was shaped with may be a little unusual and that we did ramp up production throughout the year as the demand started growing. As you might know or I would like to remember that everybody that we a very strong position in the sugarcane industry where the Valtra tractor and the reason is the doability and real ability and quality of that product. So that means we install or we instead install a capacity of around 50,000 engines. But it's we are attempting to level the production out well more this year than last year. And when it comes to investment in the future, I think our strategy will be rather to think about localizing certain components before we do assembly, because the problem in Russia is there is no local supply. Terry Darling Goldman Sachs So the net raw material is sort of a push for the year? Here in the U.S., we actually have a factory in Jackson, Minnesota for the big high horsepower four-wheel drive articulated tractor and the track tractor with no restrictions in capacity. And reference to your specific question, some of the structural things that we are changing, we are starting to get more and more tractors from our Indian supplier which moves products from Brazil to India. So we are expecting our production to remain up, but it will be at a lower percentage as we go throughout the year. We...so I don't think we really haven't an overall issue there and a lot of that growth as you say is mix related in terms of the rotation to higher horsepower business as well. We saw that already last year not only that Argentina does not pay subsidies to farmers, they also add quite a... big tax or customs on all products exported to different countries. So overall, we are fine and we are actually trying to make reasonable investments in order not to change our breakeven point too much. Second, I believe that we can do more and for the remaining months of the year and third you of course can do also some...you can generate some improvements for the...for your order book via the discounts you give. The other impact again is the material cost increases that we are seeing. The second quarter margin comment being flat you've already pointed out that the production will be up 25% in the Fendt mix will be positive. Stephen Volkmann JPMorgan Hi, good morning Andrew H. Beck Good morning Stephen Volkmann JPMorgan I was hoping you might comment a little bit on your capacity utilization, and I am really focused in the higher horsepower equipment here. The benefits we will not see this year and most probably not next year, but this is a project which will generate some important cost reductions due to a reduction in complexity. Now what we decided is to buy the intellectual property of a design that has been developed between a very well known engineer and inventor in Brazil and some of the sugar mills. If the...the fact that there is no change I think reflects the fact that our inventory levels are a little higher than we would want it at this point in the year some of the delays that Martin talked about with some our suppliers are impacting inventory levels even though we are able to get product out if affects the timing and our ability manage inventories as well as we'd like. When it comes to our existing organizational setup we are working... we took over the 100% of our importer and distribution network. And also, we have in mind of always not only capacity, but also the return on invested capital. But is the buff what we typically sell in other markets, because we've mainly sell high horsepower tractors. Looks like you are assuming that your margins will be down year-over-year in the second half and yet the production is up and you are pushing price here. We have some projects we work on in our factory in Finland in order to prepare this factory for the growth that we might see in 2009. And we do have two brands with a complete product offering and we have exclusive distribution. It looks if I look at the bar chart like in Q2 you are forecasting at least 25% year-over-year increase in production. We will most probably start with things like engines and so on before we go there with a assembly operation. So I am just trying to understand if there is something else in that revenue gap; if I misunderstand the currency flow somehow. Martin H. Richenhagen Ann, we so far decided not to do it and the reason is that we certain opportunities to invest in our business, generating pretty good return. Terry Darling Goldman Sachs And same question for price and raw material inflation please? I don't have a number ...but again you can say is from what our earlier expectation is that 50 to 75 basis points in increase in pricing is all to cover the additional inflation in the material costs. My question, first question your production was up 25% in Q1 but your outlook is for production to be up to 10%... 12% to14%. I prefer instead of giving you big numbers, I prefer to do my homework first and what we do is we are just sitting together here we last week met with the management team in order to define a more aggressive strategy for the coming years."

For the full year of 2009, our production of tractors and combines is expected to be down about 15 to 20% from 2008 levels. And then the second big portion goes into capacity and the renovation and new factories in Fendt, Germany. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, including some related to future sales, earnings, growth, production levels, work force adjustments, plant rearrangements, factory process improvements, market conditions, industry demand, weather conditions, availability of financing, general economic conditions, currency translation impacts, commodity prices, farm income, working capital improvement, cash flow, effective tax rate, interest expense, new product investments, pricing levels, engineering, research and development, capital expenditures and strategic initiatives. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO First of all, Wall Street shouldn't generate those rumors, they were not generated by us. Softer market demand in Argentina and a shift in mix to low or a horsepower tractors in Brazil, that Martin mentioned, drove most of the decrease. Our seasonal demands for working capital are greater in the first half of the year and thereby generate negative free cash flow in both the first quarter of 2009 and 2008. Let's say, we're fairly neutral and what we project going forward is that we're seeing obviously, reductions in input cost, we're seeing reductions in steel prices. The order board for North America decline during the first quarter, as well. Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division And then maybe from Martin, can you talk a little bit about -- it seems like the high horsepower equipment in the U.S, in Europe, the commentary was actually pretty good with respect to what you're saying in sales. And that you'll cut production further just to keep that cash flow goal? For 2009 we expect continued weakness for tractors under 100- horsepower and lower demand for tractors over 100-horsepower. And then what we had was a fairly strong order board at the end of the year and filling those orders through shipments into our distribution and through the retail channel occurred in the first quarter. The decline in operating margins resulted from lower gross margins, higher engineering expenses and higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. Our 2008 year end inventory levels were higher than we had planned. Significant production cuts are planned for the second quarter of 2009 and our sales and earnings in the second quarter will be significantly impacted. We have a situation in Eastern Europe and in Russia, where our dealers or distributors are probably carrying too much inventory. So in terms of looking at where our pricing was and relative to our input cost, we didn't lose any ground. Slide 4 illustrates our production volumes for 2008 and our current forecast for 2009. Lower production volumes and a weaker mix of sales in South America created a drag on our margins. Certainly dealers and some of our markets in Europe are carrying a little more inventory than they'd like. Is it right to think about half of the 8.7 is price and the rest is a combination of positive mix in inventory bill budget? First quarter 2009 tracked time combined production levels were down 5%, compared to the first quarter of 2008. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the 275 to $300 million range and free cash flow in the 150 to $200 million range, after funding the expected increases in capital. Our optimism for the long-term demand for our product is driving continued investment in our long-term growth initiatives. In terms of the credit, obviously, we provide certain amounts of the credit to our distribution in terms of, for plant lines and terms conditions. Sales in the first quarter benefited from a strong order backlog, which declined steadily throughout the quarter. Geographically, our biggest production declines are plant for our South American factories. Remember when we talked last year, how strong our order boards were and so they're getting down to levels that we've seen before. The market has declined significantly and so we're obviously working with those distributors in those markets. Lower production volumes and increased engineering expenses focus on our high horsepower tractors and new harvesting products contributed to the lower margins. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operation less capital expenditures. We hope that our payable levels stayed fairly consistent now and our objective will be reducing inventories and accounts receivable throughout the rest of the year and with that, we hope that our net working capital reduction will be about close to $100 million by the end of the year. We've seen our order boards come down and in some cases, we're holding back further shipments until we see that inventory clear. While we do plan to manage our production and working capital very closely this year, we are planning for substantial investment in engineering expenses and capital expenditures. So we've been seeing our order book come down. Despite a strong turmoil in the commodity markets, we remain confident that long-term agricultural fundamentals are excellent. The rest was operational improvement. Charlie Rentschler Wall Street Access In view of your rising capital expenditures, could you give us a little bit of detail, Martin, maybe rattle off the top two or three biggest projects that you're undertaking currently? We have more, we're taking more retail orders and building to retail order and that allows us to reduce our inventory levels, as well as our dealers. Can you talk about, in the distribution channel? Declining market demand produced lower sales volumes and significantly lower operating margins in our South American business. I mean from -- really, the key for our distribution is financing their the inventory they want to carry and certainly we're encouraging our dealers to reduce their inventory levels, turn their inventory faster. Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division It sounds like the weakness that your forecasting going forward, I don't want to put words in your mouth but it sounds like that's more in the non U.S., non-European and the lower horsepower? We expect 2009 South American industry volumes to be down significantly from 2008 record levels, due to the dry weather conditions and the impact of the tightened credit environment on planted acres and crop productions. Slide 5 details industry retail farm equipment volumes by region for the first quarter of 2009. Andrew Burris Obin BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Do you think dealers are encouraged to carry lower levels of inventory because the cost of short-term financing has gone up? Even after covering these increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting strong free cash flow this year. We believe the increase is the result of timing for deliveries for competitors' presale programs, which were pulled forward to earlier in the year to offset legal demand in export markets. There's a big demand for agricultural equipment, so that means in theory, everybody would like to buy. For the second quarter of 2009, we expect sales declines of 30 to 35% compared to the second quarter 2008 due to reduced production, the negative impacts of currency translation and softer market demand. We don't want to deal with assumptions that could be proven to be too optimistic. We also expect to end 2009 with inventory well below 2008 year-end levels. We expect global grain inventories to continue to be below historical averages and commodity prices and farm income to remain above historical levels. We started to do that already 2005 and overall it's like one third is completed, another third is in the pipeline and the third is actually not yet started. Improved margin on our sprayer products and expense control initiatives contributed to the improvement. We are very focused on working down our inventory levels by adjusting our production schedules. Have you actually seen cancellations in your order book? The deepest cut is expected in the second quarter, when our production is scheduled to be down approximately 30%, compared to the second quarter of 2008. How do you factor into the equation your pretty strong purchases by farmers over the last couple of years and some potential that, it takes a little bit longer to turn equipment demand relative to farmer income as we move into 2010, 2011. Barry Bernard Bannister Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division The history of the company is that you generate most of your free cash flow in the fourth quarter, in fact 84 to 94% of full-year free cash flow the past three years has occurred in the fourth quarter. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO In engineering? You can see from this chart that we are making aggressive cuts in the remainder of the year in an effort to reduce our inventory levels. I want to stress that with the global recession, tightened credit market and volatile commodity prices, there continues to be considerable uncertainty around the market conditions we will face this year. The weakest segment was the under 100-horsepower tractors, which are more closely tied to the redemption construction and general economic conditions. We were impacted by a number of issues, including supplier constraints, limited credit in Eastern Europe and Russia and also softening demand. Last year, we moved to distribution of our sprayers to the Caterpillar dealers and we have been investing more in new products. As usual, our inventories and accounts receivable went up, as well. In the first quarter of 2009, seasonal increases raised our inventory above year-end levels and had remained above targeted levels. As I mentioned earlier, we are holding some of those shipments until their fleets get moved back down, as well in certain circumstances. Our renewable fuels is still mid-up, changing diets, still middle, so there's actually nothing that really changed. But everything seems to be holding so far and we're hopeful it remains that way. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, we are projecting that our margins in Europe and South America will be down throughout the rest of the year and for the full year. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and an actual events or results may differ materially. As we discussed on a previous slide, we're continuing to focus on reducing our working capital and expect our progress to generate cash flow in 2009. So that means we have a pretty healthy portfolio on productivity improvement. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Sure Ann, certainly, we didn't -- we wanted to show that we can still generate the cash flow that we had in our previous forecast. We changed the build-to-order approach in other factories, so that means we have plenty of different actions and activities we work on. We are projecting 2009 sales to range from 6.7 billion to $7 billion. But in most cases, I think we're in pretty good shape with our distributor network. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO We work with them in this direction anyhow because we do not think that it makes dealers very strong to have plenty of inventory. Lower volumes in production, increased engineering expenses and the negative impacts of currency translation keeps second quarter 2009 earnings per share below half of the level of the second quarter of 2008. Now as we get to the second quarter, we cut production and we'll expect to see our sales come down fairly significantly in the second quarter in that region. We expect to see inventory declining during the second quarter and our June 30, 2009 inventories are expected to be below current levels. And we're maintaining those and certainly working with our network. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. Farmers have become more conservative with their equipment purchase decisions. How much of that, Andy, is due to the import issues with currency and so forth and how much is, kind of, core North American production, do you think? Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division And along those very lines, can you talk a little bit about what you would anticipate decremental margins to be around the different regions as you cut production rather rapidly and quickly in South America and probably in Europe also. But it was a bigger one than I expected, in terms of operating cash flow and bled off most of your cash, so is it safe to assume that if volumes disappoint in the back half, you're still targeting a mid-single-digit working capital ratio? Can you talk a little bit about how you expect to generate the same level of free cash flow given all the changes in your outlook on that P&L? It is going into core process, redesign in some of our factories. Can you explain just mechanically, what products these things apply to and whether it applies to inventory already sitting there that's not been sold, maybe just give us a recap of the mechanics of that? Strong harvests are still required to meet the growing demand for food and biofuel requirements. In the first quarter of 2009, we estimate the sales of tractors under 80 horsepower at approximately 80%, while sales of tractors over 80-horsepower in Brazil declined approximately 55% compared to the first quarter of 2008. Andrew Burris Obin BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And in so far as you mentioned that you are working with dealers to reduce their inventory, when do you think production and inventory in the channel, sort of, balance each other? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO No, I think it's pretty much a run rate, so that means, we try to use those times in order to be prepared for the future. So we're in a situation now, where we're cutting production over the course of the rest of the year with significant cuts in the second quarter in order to start to reduce that inventory level from where it is today. At the end of March 2009, our North America dealer-month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was as follows; 5.5 months per tractors, 3.5 months for combines, and eight months for hay equipment. Andrew Millard Casey Wachovia Securities, LLC, Research Division Lastly, can you comment on what happened in the input costs on a year-over-year basis during the quarter? In terms of our orders, our orders overall or about order book look at the end of March, is about half of what it was a year ago and about a quarter down from the end of the year. So the smaller load tractors and it's basically than in the countries we talked about, Eastern Europe and South America. In North America, we're projecting that our margins improved and that's because some of the cost reduction initiatives that we started last year, that market is, although, we're seeing it's down, we hope to perform well there and we are getting some benefit to currency in North America, as well. Jamie Lyn Cook Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division One, can you guys give your backlog by region or in total? That's our target and that should put us in line to generate the cash flow that we have targeted, as well. Frederick Curtis Darling Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And then also on engineering expense, which would be expecting there for the year, I think you bet 3% of sales versus 2.3% last year? While our 2009 results are important to us, we're also very focused on AGCO's long-term profitability and we will invest on increased engineering and capital expenditures this year. As we adjust inventory levels and as you mentioned as well, we'll see our distributors reduce their inventory levels, somewhat in the second quarter, as well. Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division My first question is around your outlook for free cash flow. But in Europe, that's mainly the reduction in our production volumes. But that -- we are focused on trying to get our inventories and working capital, as we remain in line with our sales levels.",empty

This trend will continue in the second quarter with the exception that our overall production levels are expected to be above the levels of the second quarter of 2009. The high horsepower segment benefited from favorable row crop economies and increased 14% compared to the first quarter of 2009. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. As Martin mentioned, we idled plants in the first quarter of 2010 to adjust our inventory levels for projected retail demand in the coming quarters. In the first quarter of 2010, operating income declined in North America due to the significant drop in sales, production cuts and dealer destocking. During the quarter, we closely managed the seasonal build of our inventories by slowing production schedules and putting some factories on temporary shutdown. In South America region, operating margins rebounded to 11.3%, an increase of over 800 basis points for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 2009. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow in a $75 million to $100 million range during 2010. This reduction helped us to manage the seasonal build in our inventory and our dealers' inventory in the first quarter of 2010. Sales and production were significantly lower in 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009, due to soft retail market conditions. In the first quarter of 2010, sales decline, slower production volumes, a weaker mix of products and high engineering expenses all contributed to the drop in our earnings. This controlled production in the first quarter positions us to improve our performance in the second half of 2010. The decline in operating margins resulted from weaker sales, lower gross margins and higher engineering and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. We are projecting 2010 sales to range from $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion, a small increase from 2009. Our dealer month supply in North America was as follows: tractors were at 4.5 months, two months for combines and seven months for hay equipment. In Brazil, strong harvest, stable commodity prices and low-interest rate, government- sponsored financing programs resulted in strong industry sales. Strong crop production Brazil and attractive financing programs provided by the government contributed to strong market demand. A higher effective tax rate and increased engineering and other project expenses will keep second quarter 2010 earnings per share below the level of the second quarter last year, with a range of $0.40 to $0.45. We are optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for our industry and our business. We expect gross margin improvements to be offset by higher engineering and pension costs. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and the actual events or results may differ materially. At the end of March 2010, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was lower in all categories and at the same time a year ago. Lower production volumes in North America and in Europe were partially offset by margin improvements in South America. You can see that the seasonal build from the year-end 2009 inventory level to the end of the first quarter of 2010 was much more controlled than in the previous two years. We plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. We still have work to do especially in the area of hay equipment. Every year, our operating plan includes a build of dealer and company inventory required for the spring selling season, and Slide 8 provides visibility into our inventory management in the first quarter. In South America, the order board is up from both first quarter 2009 level and year-end 2009 levels. In 2010, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expenses by approximately 20% or $40 million. Weak demand from dairy and livestock producers resulted in significantly lower sales of our hay equipment and mid-range tractors. We also look for our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved margins. Weaker sales, lower production volumes, sales mix and increased engineering and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales resulted in lower operating margins. Higher levels of sales and production in the second half of 2010 in both North America and Europe, stronger full year margins in South America and our global cost- reduction efforts are expected to drive the expected margin improvement. In contrast, our 2009 sales benefited from large opening order boards in the first quarter of 2009, which were carried over from the strong markets in 2008. We will make forward-looking statements including some related to projections of earnings per share, sales, market demand and conditions, margin and productivity improvements, inventory management, working capital, exchange rates, production volumes, general economic condition, pricing increases, capital expenditures, pension and benefit, planned costs and engineering. The controlled production schedule pressured our results in Europe and North America during the first quarter of 2010, but it positions us for better performance in the second half of 2010. Our significant production cuts in Europe and North America negatively impacted our first quarter sales and margins. At the end of March, the backlogs in Europe and North America are up over 30% from December 2009 levels but remained below the first quarter of 2009. We slowed the investments, some of our plant productivity projects and new products last year in response to softening market conditions. Robust market demand in Brazil and improved conditions in Argentina produced higher sales in both countries. For the full year of 2010, we are expecting tractor and combine production to be about flat to slightly up compared to 2009 levels. First quarter 2010 tractor and combine production levels were down 20% compared to the first quarter of 2009, with significantly higher production in South America, offset by heavy production cuts in both our North American and European factories. Our production volumes for 2009 and projected volumes for 2010 are illustrated on Slide 4. Increased production and the shift in mix of products towards larger high-horsepower, higher-margin tractors also contributed to the improvement. These earnings per share projections exclude restructuring expenses expected to be incurred in the company's European operations, estimated at approximately $0.10 per share for the full year of 2010. In 2010, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in China and in Russia.","Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, raw materials, we had a pretty good performance here in the first quarter and down. Sunita Desai And also, one of your competitors has said that they're having challenges ramping production and the supply chain in Lat Am [Latin America], given the speed and the extent of end-market growth. But a large majority of the engineering expense increases that we discussed, Mark, fall into Europe. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Our used inventories are higher than a year ago, but I guess we categorize them as at acceptable levels. Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division How would you characterize used inventories in North America? But as other suppliers do bring production closer to end-market demand, how are you looking for the competitive set to change in South America going forward this year? Can you talk about what kind of a price increase range we should expect for Tier 4 equipment? Mark Koznarek Cleveland Research And then finally, the raw material outlook, based on those strategic initiatives you talked about, I'm assuming that would be down for the year. The question I've got is how much underproduction will occur during the remainder of the year? And our market position is good there but not as good as in some of the high horsepower segments. Just had a quick question with respect to your comments on the backlog. You talked a little bit about inventory reductions needing more in hay tools, but can we read from that, that you're kind of where you want to be on tractors and combines and that inventory reduction has kind of run its course now? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, I think as you point out, we have not seen any difficulties with supply chain issues so far as our productions increased in Brazil and don't have any specific concerns, at this point, about anything relating to the supply chain for the balance of the year in South America. What are you hearing as far as what level of pricing would be necessary to both recoup some of the R&D investments, as well as to offset pricing pressures as your production lifts in the back half? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Used inventories are still higher than normal, yes. And also the mix has improved a little because of more combine sales in the first quarter and more High Horsepower Tractor sales than probably what we had in the fourth quarter. Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Can we tie that into -- are used inventory still high in Europe? And if not, when do you expect those dollars to start flowing? One is in the area of purchasing and materials, where under the leadership of our Senior Vice President, Materials and Purchasing, David Caplan, we work on a major program to improve our core processes, to reorganize our purchasing people to strive for more excellence or to hire some more experienced people, to go for global single sourcing and also, to increase our best cost-country sourcing. But in terms of putting engines in new tractors for Tier 4 final, that's 11, 12, 13 period of time, but it will impact our engineering expenses during that period of time. I think our inventory levels are at pretty good level now and so we should expect to sell at retail for the balance of the year. So we need to make sure that we do get potential raw material prices also into our sales prices. Or are these kind of levels that you generated in the first quarter sustainable for the remainder of the year? You're doing 2.5% of pricing now, but one of your competitors is talking about having to raise prices just to offset the engines and giving no real room for price increases for steel and materials. And what we've seen here in the first part of 2010 is a recovery in some of the high horsepower markets, particularly in the sugarcane area where we had a strong share. And Mark, I think, the big difference is the way maybe what you're looking at in fourth quarter and the first quarter's overall production volumes and looking out what's happening in the other markets as well because those factories support other markets. And I wondered if there's any optimism among farmers and in business and financing that's out in the market? We want to improve our quality, and we want to increase productivity. Mark Koznarek Cleveland Research A question about the production versus retail sales in Europe."

First quarter operating margins in our Europe/Africa/Middle East region rebounded to 8.9%. In 2011, we expect production volumes to be up in the first half of the year compared to 2010 and flat in the second half of the year, with higher production in Europe and lower in South America. We are projecting 2011 sales to range between $8.3 billion to $8.5 billion. We plan to continue to invest for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. We expect to increase capital expenditures to be in the $250 million to $300 million range, and our free cash flow to remain positive and exceed $100 million after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures. AGCO's first quarter 2011 tractor and combine production was up 17% compared to the first quarter of 2010. This year, we operated our factories at normal seasonal rates during the first quarter. We will make forward-looking statements this morning including those related to projections of earnings per share, sales, market conditions, margin improvements, profitability, the effect of acquisitions, new product development and market expansion, factory productivity, production, investments in expanding markets, free cash flow, depreciation, emission requirements, product line expansion and general economic conditions. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. Eco farm [ph] fundamentals produced growth in Argentina and other South American countries, offsetting weaker sales in Brazil. A weaker geographic mix and lower levels of production and higher expenses contributed to the decline. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2010 and projected volumes for 2011 are illustrated on Slide 4. Recall that last year in the first quarter, we managed 2 weaker markets in the U.S. and Western Europe, and we were focused on inventory reduction. Improved crop production and increased credit availability contributed to the market strength in Argentina. Equipment order boards in North America were also up significantly from March 2010 levels. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow of over $100 million during 2011. Margins were improved in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to higher sales and production volume and a richer mix of products. First quarter 2011 operating margins also benefited from higher levels of production and improved leverage over operating costs compared to the first quarter of 2010. AGCO's order board for the EAME market at the end of March 2011 has more than doubled, compared to end of March 2010. Despite a larger build of inventory to support our projected sales growth, our use of cash is slightly better than this point a year ago. Improving order flow, along with increased production levels in our European and North American factories, were offset by lower production volume in South America. Our dealer month supply in North America was as follows: tractors were not 5.9 months, 4 months for combine and 8 months for hay equipment. The benefit of increased production volumes and the leverage over our operating expenses resulted in the improvement. In 2011, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, improve our factory productivity in Germany and make investments in China and Russia. At the end of March 2011, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was higher than the same period, the same time a year ago in preparation for forecasted growth in 2011. High-horsepower tractors declined nearly 8% compared to the strong levels in the first quarter of 2010. For the full year of 2011, we expect production to be up 5% to 10% from 2010 levels. In the first quarter of 2011, operating margins improved significantly in North America, also due to higher sales and production. Sales growth in Eastern Europe and Russia produced most of the increase. We introduced profitable new products, reorganized our sales organization, lowered our logistics cost and improved the efficiency of our factories. South American order boards remain strong, but were down from very high levels at the end of the first quarter of 2010. In North America, the economics for row crop farmers continued to be outstanding, and the market demand for large equipment remains robust. Higher commodity prices and improvement in the dairy and livestock sector contributed to the growth. Higher crop prices for grain and dairy farmers in Western Europe and improving farmer sentiment are expected to generate market growth of about 15% compared to the weak levels experienced in 2010.","Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division And, Greg, should that cover your anticipated input commodity costs, inflation and all that for the year then? You kind of referenced some increases in combines and some other equipment. As you'll recall, we, last year, put in some pricing in the second half of the year for our Tier 4 equipment."

These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. In 2012, we expect to increase our capital expenditures to approximately $350 million as we continue to work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve factory productivity and complete the expansion at Fendt and establish assembly facilities in China. The inventory build in the first quarter of 2012 was attributable to both the normal seasonality, as well as to the altered production schedules in Europe. Margins improved nearly 300 basis points in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to higher sales and production volumes, combined with cost controls and a favorable mix associated with the accelerated Fendt production. For the full year of 2012, we expect production to be up 10% to 12% from 2011 levels. In the first quarter of 2012, operating margins in North America, excluding acquisition impact, exceeded 7% due to higher sales and production, a favorable sales mix and cost-control initiatives. The benefit of increased production volumes and pricing was partially offset by increased material costs and higher engineering and marketing expenses. Strong order books with increased production levels in our European and North American factories were offset by lower production volumes in South America. Slide 11 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash used in operating activities, less capital expenditures. Acquisitions generated nearly all of the growth. Sales growth across Asia produced most of the organic increase. The combined market was down significantly compared to the first quarter of 2011 due to the timing of industry production and due to very high levels of demand seen last year. Margins were lower compared to the first quarter of 2011 due to expenses associated with acquisition and increased engineering and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions. In North America, industry sales of high horsepower and utility tractors both increased due to continued positive conditions for row crop farmers and improvement in the dairy and livestock sectors. We expect to have lower production at our plant in Germany during the third quarter to facilitate the transition of our brand new assembly facility in Marktoberdorf. The farm production schedule in 2012 is more heavily weighted to both the first and second quarters. We expect to increase capital expenditures to be in the $350 million range and our free cash flow to exceed $200 million after funding the expected increase in CapEx. Our European production benefited from the pull forward of farm production into the first quarter. We also look for new products in our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. AGCO's first quarter 2012 production was up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2011. We expect to generate strong cash flow again this year and plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expenses and additional investments in our plants and new products. We project the GSI acquisition will be accretive to 2012 earnings per share by about $0.45 per share. We'll make forward-looking statements this morning, including statements that are not historical fact, including the projections of earnings per share, sales, free cash flow, market conditions, farmer income, harvests, weather, market share, margin improvements, production levels, new product development, factory productivity, investments in facilities and expanding markets, government financing programs, industry demand, impacts of foreign currency, general economic conditions, depreciation, emission requirements, pricing benefits, plant shutdowns, engineering expenses, startup and market support costs, capital expenditures and the impact of the GSI acquisition. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. AGCO's use of cash in the first quarter of 2012 was stronger than the first quarter of 2011 due to our higher inventory build for the selling season. The accelerated production dealer shipments in Germany that Martin referenced earlier contributed to the increase. Our SG&A expense is expected to include expenses associated with site and manufacturing startup and market support costs amounting to about $20 million for Fendt and $20 million to $25 million for our Chinese operations. Our dealer month's supply in North America was as follows: Tractors were 6.5 months, 3 months for combine and 7.5 months for hay equipment. In 2012, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements are expected to cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 15% or $40 million. AGCO's order book is up between 10% and 25% across all regions at the end of March 2012 compared to March 2011 levels. Including significant planned investments in product development, market development and startup costs associated with our manufacturing projects, we expect to continue to improve gross and operating margins from 2011 levels. Our order boards remain strong, and we are projecting 2012 sales in the $10.2 billion to $10.5 billion range. Better harvest in Russia and Eastern Europe in 2012 are expected to produce robust growth in these markets. Even after covering increased spending on those strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow in over $200 million range during 2012. In North America, the economics for row crop farmers continue to be outstanding, and the market demand for large equipment remains very strong. In 2012, we expect production volumes to be up for the remainder of the year, with higher production in Europe and North America. First quarter demand in South America was adversely impacted by the dry conditions in Southern Brazil and Argentina, and our production was reduced accordingly. Every year, our first quarter operating plan includes a build of dealer and company inventory required for the spring selling season. Inventories are higher during the transition at our Valtra plant in Finland, where we are installing SAP, and at the Fendt plan in Germany, where we are building a new assembly facility. At the end of March 2012, our North America dealer month's supply on a trailing 12-months basis was lower for combines and hay equipment and higher for tractors than the same time a year ago. We also look for improvement in the dairy and livestock sectors, which will help hay equipment demand.","We're hopeful that the balance of the year in South America is improved as farmers have their next production to be more successful. I know Fendt and the high horsepower tractors had very solid share in 2011, but it looks like that may have moved up. And then just lastly, on the tractor inventories being up in North America, can you just frame that for us, the 6.5% versus what and your level of comfort there? We've got a number of projects in place to establish better distribution and establish some manufacturing capabilities overseas as well. Just want to know, what have dealers and farmers told you about their orders -- for tractors, although later in the year, given the big increases in North America for the row crop planting? Michael Shlisky JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division It's Mike Shlisky, filling in for Ann. These are where we're going to optimally grow the business and that's what we're focused on with GSI. So as we begin to transition as Martin talked about, and ramp up our plant in Jackson, Minnesota, you should expect to see our North American tractor inventories go down over time. We found opportunities to collocate some of their operations into our operations. Just the distribution. And in terms of -- Andy, the performance in the fourth quarter, pricing and material costs, can you step us through that? We were a little cautious in our first quarter because of some of the transitions we're working on, and we are able to get more production out into our dealers' hands a little ahead of schedule, which helped us in the first quarter. I saw you guys had a pretty strong order boards in the first quarter. Jerry David Revich Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Can you update us on the timing of the Argentina local capacity ramp and import approval process, sort of where do we stand? And so we historically have brought -- our tractor inventories in North America have historically been a little higher than industry average since we were still sourcing from Europe. We look for that positive benefit to continue for the rest of the year, absent any -- obviously absent any major changes in key commodities like steel, for us. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, I think from the first question, in terms of distribution, it's still early, but we do have a lot of interest from dealers outside of North America to help us in disturbing that product. Could you just elaborate on that? And then on the Europe business, as you do the Fendt production transition, should we expect a margin impact there in the second half of the year? And then as you throw in then some engineering -- additional engineering expense and some marketing and product development expenses, those kind of contributed to the decline year-over-year. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Henry, we -- I think we said in our comments that we have about 3 months worth of inventory, so that's really good shape for us. We're anxious to advance ourselves with that product in markets like Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, and we think that some shared distribution will be effective there. We also benefited in the quarter as we talked about from higher production levels, and that was probably close to 50 basis points. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Our Jackson tractor assembly -- brand new Jackson tractor assembly factory will open in May, so that will help as well. And when you look at Eastern Europe, how much pull-through of used equipment out of Western Europe is contributing to sort of demand levels? Could you talk about how the inventories look? Is that primarily due to the production issue? Your order books are looking a lot better than that? Also, mainly in the high horsepower category and, therefore, I'm rather optimistic. Ashish Ravi Gupta CLSA Americas, LLC, Research Division And then just on GSI, I'm just wondering you had mentioned before that a lot of your dealers were eager to distribute GSI in your initial conversations. So we looked at our order boards for the balance of the year and have increased our projections on sales in some markets, particularly looking at Western Europe and North America is where we see most of that growth. In the -- What we expect is -- as we said we pulled some sales forward in Fendt over our normal flow of production and sales, and we'll see that in the third quarter, where the sales for the Fendt product will be lower. And just remind us if you've changed your material cost forecast as part of your guidance revision. We saw then, that gave us a benefit after you look at material cost increases, gave us a benefit, somewhere between 75 and 100 basis points positive in the quarter. We saw the market strong, and if you look at our sales for the quarter -- our high horsepower tractor sales were up close to 30% -- actually over 30%. On the second quarter -- fourth quarter call, you had mentioned that you had looked for 1Q to be flat year-over-year on an earnings basis and that your 2Q would be exceptionally strong because of the downtime in Finland and otherwise. We have some significant projects that we'll still be working through in 2013 and '14, particularly our expansion into Asia and some other major product -- projects associated with new products and expansions into Eastern Europe as well, and so we would expect those levels of capital to probably -- to be -- likely to be spent at least -- during next year. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes, I think that the -- what we're seeing is a good retail order board that matches our good order board that we have with our dealers. So we don't have as high production there, so the margins come back down. Given the strength -- combine is up 24% in Q1, tractors up a little bit and the strength of your order board, does your guidance for Europe imply weakness in the second half of the year? So we're still moving forward with those discussions and activities as we continue to bring GSI into AGCO on a more formal basis. Is that just a function of you want one more quarter under your belt before you raise that end market outlook or are you concerned about slowing trajectory of order growth?"

We expect an increased capital expenditures to be in the range of $400 million to $425 million and free cash flow in excess of $150 million after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures and higher inventory levels associated with the Tier 4 product transition. North America operating margins exceeded 11% in the first quarter of 2013, up over 250 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2012 due to higher sales, a favorable sales mix and cost control initiatives. These documents discuss important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. Operating margins were negatively impacted by higher engineering expenses associated with Tier 4 requirements and market development expenses. In 2013, we expect to further increase our capital expenditures as we continue to work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirement, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in China. In 2013, our full year production is forecasted to be higher than 2012 with most of the increase coming in the second half of the year due to the low production rate experienced during last year's ramp-up in the new facility. As expected, sales mix and Fendt productivity impacted EAME's first quarter operating margins. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes are illustrated on Slide 4. We expect to generate strong cash flow again this year and plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. As I mentioned earlier, our production volumes at our Fendt plant in Germany improved throughout the first quarter, and our total output was higher than expected. In North America, the economics for row crop farmers continue to be outstanding and the market demand for large equipment remains very strong in the region. Our seasonal requirements for working capital are greater in the first half of the year and thereby result in negative free cash flow in the first quarter 2012 and in '13. In 2012, Fendt had a front-end loaded production schedule ahead of the cutover to the new assembly facility in the third quarter. U.S. grain storage sales were negatively affected by the carryover impacts of last year's drought. We also look for new products and our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. Higher levels of production in our South American and North American factories were offset by lower build rates in Europe. We are projecting 2013 sales in the range from $10.5 billion to $10.7 billion. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. For 2013, our SG&A expense will include expenses associated with site and manufacturing start-up and market support costs amounting to about $10 million for our Chinese operations. AGCO's order boards at the end of March 2013 were approximately flat in North America, down in Europe and up significantly in South America compared to the end of 2012. The positive economics being experienced by the professional farming segment produced increases in high horsepower tractors, combines and implements. We expect unit production volumes for the full year of 2013 to be modestly higher as compared to 2012. First quarter 2013 production was flat compared to the first quarter of 2012. In addition, production rates at our new Fendt assembly facility in Germany increased to normal levels during the first quarter. Favorable exchange impacts, cost-reduction benefits and higher sales volumes produced most of the increase. Favorable exchange and financing rates, improved weather and attractive soft commodity prices have energized the market in South America. Growth in China and East Asia produced most of the increase. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. In 2013, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense of approximately 15% or about $50 million. At the end of March 2013, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was approximately 5 months for tractors, 4 months for combine and 8 months for hay equipment. We also expect to achieve improved production efficiency and costs in the second half of 2013. Europe, Africa, Middle East operating margins were down in the first quarter of 2013 from the high levels achieved in the first quarter of 2012 due to lower production volumes, a weaker mix of products and the impact of net factory start-up costs. Relative to last year, this was lower for tractors and flat for both hay equipment and combines. We also expect improved gross and operating margins from 2012 levels after significant investments in product development, market development and start-up costs associated with our manufacturing projects. The strongest growth came from the high horsepower segment due to the healthy income levels of row crop farmers. We are projecting earnings growth in the second half of 2013 compared to the same period of last year.","Michael E. Cox Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division My first question is a comment that was made in the prepared remarks about building inventory at the end of the year and buildup for the final Tier 4. This is -- I would say that maybe you see some benefit in 2014, but probably more 2015, '16 will be the more significant benefits out of all of these investments and projects we have going on. Or is it more sort of just a catch-up on needed equipment? Can you give us an update on the -- your visibility you have in your order book and then how it compares to last year at this time? But overall, we are very optimistic and very positive about the market environment also for the years to come. During the first quarter, we had what we're calling start- up costs or lower productivity in that facility that amounted to about $15 million. From a cost standpoint, the productivity is still not in line with where we will ultimately want to see it. So overall, we have a very solid operational cooperation and alliance with TAFE. Michael E. Cox Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division And then on the production side, within that 5% to 7% production increase, some portion of that, I assume, is related to this? The owner of TAFE is a member of our board, and the family wanted to make sure that everybody understands how serious they see their cooperation with AGCO and therefore, they started to invest. Some of that growth is related -- going forward, anyway -- related to GSI but then also to the fact that we're building a plant there and localizing a lot of production. Things are -- the environment with the more volatile crop prices is a benefit to that -- the grain storage business. Also, material cost in our factories was well under control. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO We do not have a specific insight, but we are in very close contact with some of the big seed growers and they're all optimistic and no concern, whatsoever. So we're making progress with the output as well as the productivity in the plant. And so we will buy more and more components in India. And then third, we distribute Massey Ferguson tractors made by TAFE in India in markets mainly like North America, South America, but also Africa. And so now in the period when -- where we've got that plant under construction, as you say, we're developing the market, we have a lot of market development expenses. First question is just on Fendt production. We see some upside, yes, in North America in grain storage, but also in broilers and layers in China due to the bird flu. So with normal production levels at the Fendt facility now or even maybe a little bit better than we saw year-over-year with the additional capacity, should mix be neutral to maybe positive going forward from here? And you can see this, we call it, best cost country sourcing getting more traction. And then when you look into Southern Europe, Spain and Italy, they are still slower than previous years, but that doesn't have such a big impact on us because they're mainly consuming small tractors from local Italian suppliers. And that was well under control. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Yes, well, the normalized levels of production are being actually record levels because we now can take advantage of the new capacity, and we're talking about 90 to 100 units per day. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO It's a catch-up on needed equipment. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO We will-- we start production of our new platform of products in 2014. And so they just also need product, capacity wise, in certain areas, like for example, in harvesting. So that means, overall, we are very optimistic that we will have a pretty good year. Are you starting to see any improvement on the grain storage side? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes, on the order board, our orders are all up from where we were at the end of the year. I was wondering if you could quantify what that impact might be, either on inventory levels or production. A lot of the initiatives are aimed at our material costs. Our order visibility overall is about 3 to 4 months. With the China production coming online, is this something we should start to see benefiting margins in 2014? Second, we generate earnings and they contribute to our margin improvements because they are our, you could call that agency for all sourcing in India. On the -- it's on the inventory side, we'll be having to build up inventory to transition ourselves into the new -- production of the new Tier 4 products that we will be putting in, in 2014. And did SIMA drive any pickup in orders in 1Q or do you expect to see any follow-through in 2Q? Could you just talk about it from a cost perspective and how costs are aligned with those production rates right now? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Most of the improvement is in the second half of the year; we still project our sales to be down in the second quarter. Our projection right now is that our inventory levels related to that buildup will be in the $125 million range for the year. So as Martin said, the production levels are in line with where we project them and need them to be to meet our demand for our customers."

Lower production volumes and a weaker mix of products compared to the second quarter of 2008 resulted in a drop in adjusted operating margins to 4.5%. In the third and fourth quarter, we will have additional temporary plant shutdowns on top of the normal maintenance shutdowns. For 2009, we expect the largest declines for tractors under 100 horsepower and lower demand for tractors over 100 horsepower compared to 2008 industry retail sales levels. It also highlights the need we have to further reduce our inventories in the second half of the year. Softer market demand in Argentina and Brazil and the shift in mix to lower horsepower tractors and Brazil drove most of the decline. During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements including some related to future sales, earnings, production levels, market share improvements, general economic conditions, currency translation impacts, farm income, working capital and its components, cash flow, margins, effective tax rate, interest expense, retail sales financing, pricing levels, capital expenditures, plant shutdowns and strategic initiatives. We have more work to do and plan to underproduce projected retail demand in the second half of the year. Lower production volumes and a weaker mix of sales in South America were partially offset by improvements in North America. In response of the softening demand, our full year 2009 production of tractor and combines is expected to be down about 20% to 25% from 2008 levels. The credit constraint markets of Eastern Europe and Russia have seen the sharpest declines. Higher sales on high-horsepower tractors and balers were offset by declines in compact and midrange tractors. We expect additional production cuts and dealer destocking will lead to lower net sales and margins in the second half of the year. We started a discipline program to lower our inventory levels in order to deliver on our targeted levels of 2009 free cash flow. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. Slide 5 details industry, retail farm equipment volumes by region for the first six months of 2009. The softening global demand is evidenced in our order boards which has declined significantly. At the end of June 2009, our North America dealer month's supply on a trailing 12-month basis was higher than the same time a year ago. At the end of June, the backlog was just under half the level we saw at June 30, 2008. Working down our inventory levels in the second half of the year is a top priority. The positive impact of the stronger dollar on imported tractors, lower warranty costs and expense control initiatives all contributed to the improvement. While we have made a significant reduction in our inventory since the end of March, our strong production cuts have also resulted in lower accounts payables which limited the benefit in working capital and cash flow. Second quarter 2009 tractor and combined production levels were down 35% compared to the second quarter of 2008. We have reduced our production, lowered our work force level by over 17% and cut operating expenses. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $250 million to $275 million range and free cash flow in the $150 million to $200 million range after funding our strategic investments. We believe much of the increase is the result of timing for deliveries for competitors' presale programs which were pulled forward to earlier in the year to accept weaker demand in export market and full year demand to end up below 2008 levels. For the third quarter of 2009, we expect softer market demand, inventory reduction, the negative impacts of currency translation to result in sales declines of 25% to 30% compared to the third quarter of 2008. In Western Europe, dairy farmers and meat producers has been hit hard by low prices and industry sales in those sectors are down significantly. Declining market demand produced lower sales and significantly lower production led to the drop in operating margins in our South America business. We are targeting to the end 2009 with inventory below 2008 year end levels. Martin will walk you through our planned production cuts which are aimed at lowering our company in the order inventory levels. As a result, we expect reductions in working capital will contribute to cash flow generation in the second half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter. Weak market demand, lower production and mix of product heavily weighted towards lower margin. We expect 2009 South American industry retail volumes to be down significantly from 2008 levels due to the dry weather conditions and the impact of tightened credit on planted acreage and crop production. Weaker sales, lower production volumes and increased engineering expenses focused on our high-horsepower tractors and new harvesting products contributed to the margin compression. Our seasonal demands for working capital are greater in the first half of the year and thereby generated negative free cash flow for both the first half of 2009 and 2008. During the second quarter, when we typically see a seasonal build in inventories, we were able to bring down inventory by more than $235 million on a constant-currency basis compared to March 2009 levels. The challenging global economic conditions and the volatility in commodity prices contributed to a great deal of conservatism and farmers equipment purchase decisions. The most significant declines occurred in the sub [ph] 100-horsepower Tractor segment which are closely tied to the weak areas of residential construction and livestock production. With the uncertainty around market demand in mind, we are projecting 2009 sales to range from $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion. Lower sales in production, increased engineering expenses and the negative impacts of currency translation will keep third quarter 2009 earnings per share below half of the level in the third quarter of 2008. In the second half of the year, we expect inventory reductions to outpace our stabilizing payables position. Industry retail sales of higher horsepower tractors were down significantly for the first six months of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. With the global recession, tightened credit markets and volatile commodity prices, there remains an uncertainty around the market conditions we face in the second half of the year. We’ve reduced assembly shift at our plants in Brazil and Finland and reduced fabrication, welding and paint shifts at our plants in Jackson, Minnesota and Hesston, Kansas. The decline in operating margins resulted from weaker sales, lower gross margins and higher engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales. As Martin explained, we plan to continue to invest for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. Slide 4 now illustrates our production volumes for 2008 and the first half of 2009 as well as our current forecast for the remainder of 2009. Despite the pressure from lower production levels, operating margins surpassed 5.5% as new products, lower warranty experience, improved factory productivity and the positive impact of currency translation all contributed to margin expansion. These production cuts will have a significant impact on our second half sales and earnings with the heaviest impact in the third quarter. While our 2009 results are very important to us, we are also focused on AGCO's long term profitability and we will maintain our investments in engineering and capital expenditures this year. Lower horsepower tractors and the negative impact of currency all contributed significantly lower sales and operating income. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow which represents cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures. They were 5.5 months for tractors, six months for combines and 8.5 months for hay equipment. Even after covering increased spending in these strategic investments, we are targeting improved free cash flow this year.","I would say that we do have a pretty good order board on the new large range tractor that we just started introducing here right at the half a year and looking forward to getting those deliveries in from our European factories and supplying those in the second half of the year. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO And we also reengineered some of our lower horsepower tractors and now under in production, particularly in a Vulture business with a lower cost version of these low horsepower tractors that we think will help enhance our margins in the second half. Can you talk about, given the age of the global combine fleet, given the amount of land likely to come into production in various parts of the world, likely replacements rates, how do you see the combine market developing over the next two to three years? They call it export value customs or something like that. But a quarter of the decline was relating to mix and higher warranty cost and then another quarter was due to losing leverage over our SG&A, our engineering spend that we had in the second quarter in South America. I think the bear [ph] case, Martin, part of it is -- look, their replacement cycle in combines in particular, has been really robust and therefore, you're going to see a significant decline in industry level combine sales. So that means there is a need for farm equipment. And what we also will see that they don't have enough equipment to harvest later on. Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Can you talk just a little bit then, as a follow up, a little bit about working capital management in particular, what are going to have to do in inventories by region. Barry Bernard Bannister Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division When I look at your balance sheet items, your inventory turns really aren't that far out of line. It's most probably too late for this year when it comes to harvesting equipment. So as we reduced our production down 35%, our payables go down the like because we're really pulling down our production inventory, as well. Overall I'm slightly optimistic that Brazil might come back. It's not of our European production. And so now that we can work the rest of our inventory levels down, that should flow better into free cash flow in the second half. As we look into the second half of the year, we are going to cut our production more significantly in North America to get our dealer and company inventories in place and so, that will hurt our margins in the second half. We have a very good global footprint and I believe we have a very good strategy and we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives, including also our R&D activities. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO And just to give you kind of price idea, a tractor between 60-horsepower and 80-horsepower in this segment is typically something like $10,000, but really low end. So what you can see is you also have to look at it horsepower-wise and capacity-wise, so that means number of units typically might go down slightly but the units, too get bigger and bigger and that means also, they're more interesting margin-wise. Andrew Burris Obin BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Is it fair to take this 10% to 15% assume a certain share of European production and then apply some sort of decremental margin to that, is that a fair way of thinking about it to figure out the impact on European profitability ? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Our JV does not have operations in Eastern Europe or Russia and so, we're rely on external financing in those markets and that's one of the issues obviously. So that means this year already engines would be available for local assembly which represent a rough costs, already a very nice portion of localization and we are working on a light-assembly operation or facility for tractors and also combines. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO I believe 1/3 are 20% to 30% temps, so that gives us the right flexibility and helps us to relate quickly. Andrew Burris Obin BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division The question in terms of under destocking in North America, could you quantify by any chance thinking about second half of the year, how much under absorption we're going to have in Western European operations as we get rid of North American inventory? We are taking additional action in order to make a stronger in the future and now the question is, what will happen and I'm not in a position to tell you or to give you more details on 2010 because our work for the 2010 budget starts in September, October and it would be too early to now guess and give you a guesstimate on. We have basically launched a project for a new generation of combines for basically, most markets but the most important one is Europe, where we develop a so called hybrid combine which is a mixture between a conventional worker and an actual flown [ph] machine and this project is on schedule. So we only do farm equipment, we do not have carry the burden of weaker demand from construction equipment and things like that. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO My only comment on this is, as far as Russia is concerned, there is a desperate need for equipment. What bill did you pay that cost that larger cash outflow and that larger decline in accounts payable? Jamie Lyn Cook Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Just to follow-up on the South American margin, you said pricing was down, but can you also break out how much mix are in on the fact that you underproduced, I think in South America dramatically. The average age of the fleet is 15+ years and within the last 10 years the population of farm equipment for combines and tractors only was cut in half. So we did have a good order situation there. And so our inflow of our new material into the plants and into our parts facilities was down substantially in the second quarter and really the first half of the year. I do would say that our sales would be impacted in the second half in North America by probably an additional 10% to 15%, as a result of what we're trying to do with our dealer inventories. Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Back to the operations, I guess, Martin. And then our expense reduction activities also contributed. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Our orders are down in all categories of equipment in North Americas, as well as the rest of the world as we talked about. What you can see is acreage which has not be used for farming because they didn't have equipment for soil preparation and planting and seeding. Approximately half of the decline was relating to the lower production and the higher costs associated with that, with the lower absorption of our fixed cost. It's just a level of activities down and so, as we said in our comments, we expect the payable balance to now stabilize a little more. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO The way you have to do that would be certainly, the amount of production that we're taking out and then some absorption factor will hurt our margins, not only in North America but in Western Europe, you're correct. Year to date, they're down about 5% and because of the production changes and other factors, we're slightly profitable but down from the level of profitability that we had in 2008. And in Argentina, we just have a very small operation that we manage very tightly and so, there are some delinquencies there, but they're not material to the company. And we took action pretty early, so that means the idea was to take radical steps at the beginning, in order to make sure that we get cash flow into the right direction inventories down. Robert Cameron Wertheimer Morgan Stanley, Research Division In South America, was there any issue with not being able to not having as much of a temporary workforce or not being able to idle factories as much? And maybe while we're doing that, we could just throw in sort of a quick Challenger update in the process. So therefore, I'm slightly optimistic that it will change. They have a very aged fleet. So that means we launched that combine in fall, there's a big European -- the biggest farm equipment show in the world in Germany called architechnica [ph] and that's where we will launch that new generation of combines. The situation in Argentina is more difficult to understand and I think the government in Argentina is doing an extremely poor job in their agriculture strategies and politics, because the Argentinian farmer has to take the burden of an export duty of about 30%. I think a reduction of the export duties would help them already to be in a position to invest more. Jerry David Revich Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Can you talk about which regions you're more optimistic on and others for a potential 2010 recovery? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO If those payable declines go with production pretty closely. We've replace some of -- we talked about last year, replacing some of our tractors that we supplied to Brazil with some Indian source tractors, and those are coming on stream and helping as with our mix and our margins on those categories of tractors. I don't have a breakdown between high and low, our tractors' orders are down. You might recall that we started a engine joint venture together with the biggest manufacturer of farm equipment, the company called CTP, for diesel engines. Could you characterize the orders and backlog that you're seeing for the higher horsepower equipment that you supply into that market? The prototypes are harvesting right now and the results with regard to yield and productivity are very impressive. Jerry David Revich Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay, so it didn't sound like you need to set up some light assembly there to get product into the market, sounds like you can get around the barriers they put up?"

In the South America region, operating margins rebounded to 9.3%, an increase of over 800 basis points for the second quarter of 2010 compared to 2009. We expect gross margin improvements to be partially offset by higher engineering and pension costs. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. Our dealer month supply in North America was as follows: tractors were 4.5 months, four months for combines and seven months for hay equipment. Our tractor and combine production volumes for 2009 and projected volumes for 2010 are illustrated on Slide 4. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and actual events or results may differ materially. In the second quarter of 2010, operating income declined in North America due to lower sales and production cut. Operating margins were also improved, but increased expenditures for engineering and other initiatives mitigated some of the improvement. In 2010, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 20% or $40 million. Dealer inventory, destocking initiatives and softer end market demand in the Dairy and Cattle Producer segments contributed to the decline. Our order boards in North America are up about 20% and our South American order boards are nearly double what they had been at the end of June 2009. The high horsepower segment benefited from favorable row crop economies and increased 10% compared to the first half of 2009. We still have work to do in the area of hay equipment. Increased production volumes in South America and lower material cost contributed to the improvement. AGCO's second quarter 2010 free cash flow of $195 million was generated from working capital reductions and improved margins. Our factories operated at more normal production levels in the second quarter, with our second quarter 2010 tractor and combine production levels up 28% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow in the $75 million to $100 million range during 2010. We slowed the investment in some of our plant productivity projects and new products last year in response to softening market conditions. Sales and production were significantly lower in 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009, due to soft retail market conditions. Improved crop production and increased credit availability contributed to the improved results in Argentina. Higher production levels and material cost management helped achieve higher margins in the second quarter. While demand continues to be weak in Europe, we have achieved stabilization in the order flow from our dealers and our order board in Europe is up about 25% at the end of June 2010 compared to the end of June 2009. We are optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for our industry and our business. As a result of stronger cash flow results for the first half of 2010, our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of June 2010 was significantly better than at this point a year ago. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Every year, our operating plan includes a build of dealer and company inventory required for the spring selling seasons. The lower production in North America and Europe over the first half of the year helped us manage the seasonal build in our inventory and our dealers’ inventory in 2010. We're projecting 2010 sales to range from $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion, a small increase from 2009. At the end of June 2010, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was lower in all categories than the same time a year ago. Higher levels of sales and production in the second half of 2010 in both North America and Europe, stronger full-year margins in South America and our global cost-reduction efforts are expected to drive the expected margin improvement. Significantly higher production in South America was offset by lower production in both North America and European factories. We plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. We expect that the higher production in the back half of 2010 will produce higher gross margins compared to the second half of 2009. Strong crop production in Brazil and the attractive financing program supported by the government contributed to strong market demand. Weak demand from the dairy and livestock producers resulted in significantly lower sales of our hay equipment and mid-range tractors. Increased production and the shift in the mix of products towards larger high horsepower, higher-margin tractors also contributed to the improvement. We'll also make forward-looking statements including some related to projections of earnings per share, sales, market demand and conditions, margin and productivity improvements, cost-reduction efforts, assembly capabilities, product line initiatives, working capital, free cash flow, exchange rates, production volumes, general economic conditions, pricing increases, capital expenditures, pension and benefit plan costs and restructuring engineering expenses. In the second half of 2010, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in China and in Russia. As Martin mentioned, we reduced our production in Europe and North America and our position for better performance in the second half of 2010 compared to 2009. We also look for productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved margins. We're also now forecasting a decline of 10% to 15% in Western Europe; mild growth in the North American tractor and combine markets, with continued weakness in the North America hay equipment market; and a 20% to 25% growth in South America. Robust market demand in Brazil and improved conditions in Argentina produced higher sales in both countries. Weaker sales, lower production volumes and increased engineering expenses were partially offset by lower material costs. For the full year of 2010, we are projecting our total tractor and combine production to be up 5% to 8% from 2009 levels. The production increases in the second quarter resulted in growth in our accounts receivable and a net reduction to working capital.","And then on a dealer side, we talked a little in our prepared remarks about where we are in North America, where we still would like to see our month supply come down in the hay equipment but are pleased with where we stand with the rest of our inventory. And this will not change for 2011 so much, not caused by a backlog or some problems, but by the overall programs we are working on. Of course, we had some weather issues in some parts of Europe mainly like Spain, South of France, but also in some parts of Eastern Germany and Scandinavia, it was pretty hot and we had a kind of drought mainly giving us -- Or let's say the problem which was created by that are low yields in wheat and very low yields in corn. And then in Europe, I think our dealer inventory is down at relatively low levels now, which should put us in a better position to perform in the second half of the year. First question, I guess, can you reconcile the comment about the order book being up, 100% year-over-year, but you're only looking for flattish sales in the second half? So I think our mix is a little different, but as we get our inventories more in line as we have through the first half of the year, we'll see sales growth in the second half in North America. In general, we are at the same time, of course, also trying to become more productive and more efficient in engineering. And so we are more reliant on the dairy sector than as much than the high horsepower and combine sector. So they were in South America, so we've seen a mix of about 5% difference this year to more high horsepower tractors than last year. I have a -- when we look at Challenger now, I'm going to include sprayers because it's really the same distribution network. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes, our high horsepower tractor sales were up about 5% of the total. So I don't think there's any issues with any of our projects. The mix of sales is very different and production levels, particularly like in the third quarter, are down because you have your factory shutdown, holiday shutdowns and things like that. Robert Cameron Wertheimer Morgan Stanley, Research Division The second question will be in Russia as locally-manufactured content sort of starts to gear up, do think there's demand immediately there? When we get to second half, we still expect to manage our material costs fairly effectively. But on the other hand, we know that the population of existing farm equipment is pretty old and that farmers desperately need new equipment. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO First quarter to second quarter production was up about 20%. But the real question is, because you appear to be back-end loaded in this spending, will there be -- are there projects that are going to roll into 2011 that will keep the engineering expense high? So overall, we're looking for production to be up over for the full year now. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO I can just tell you that production should be up fairly significantly here in the third quarter overall and then up slightly in the fourth. Lawrence Tighe De Maria Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division As far as production levels go, what are you guys thinking about Europe in the fourth quarter production levels to ensure that you guys maintain obviously pretty solid profitability like you have here in the second quarter going into next year so we don't have to close down the factories again in the first quarter? But to Martin's point, we talked a little about our engineering run rates and I think those will stay somewhat consistent, and that's the part that's non-capitalized. Material costs were lower by about, improved our margins by about 60 basis points as well as the higher production improved our margins by about 60 basis points. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, our inventory levels of the company and our dealers, we believe we're in pretty good shape. Our plan is to -- as we get into new model year pricing in the second half, there'll be some element of the price increase in there and then as the actual new Tier 4 products are released and start shipping in 2011, there'll be some element of pricing on that as well. Mark Koznarek Cleveland Research Sort of the chatter through the dealers is that it's going to be cumulative across those two price increases on the order of 10%, is that roughly correct? We're still working down some inventory relating to the weak markets in Eastern Europe, but that's a relatively modest amount. What's happening in North America in the first half compared to what happened in the first half of last year is that we're still spending time getting our dealer inventories down and we are being impacted by a very weak hay market, which is an important product line for us in North America. And so we would expect to see demand from that segment and that horsepower range to continue to be strong in the future as a result. We don't produce tractors on inventory just because of that. So if people would -- the later they order, the more difficult it becomes. So I think the order board, you'll see the order board kind of level off to last year as we get into the third quarter. I think we don't expect to be as strong as we were in the first half, there's still some pressure on some of the input costs that we're seeing. And then for us, we had some additional discounting that we saw in the market in hay equipment, which again is an important segment for us in North America. So our inventory levels are where we want them to be on our company side in most cases. But overall, we still expect material costs to be flattish in the second half. Lawrence Tighe De Maria Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division So in other words, inventory going into the first quarter of next year in Europe, according to plan anyway, should be fine? Barry Bernard Bannister Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division Under the prior management, to a limited extent, and even under the current management to a greater extent, AGCO's periodically made some large investments in process improvements. We have a new guy on our Board of Directors from Secretary  of State, who is very optimistic also about the small tractor business and who believes that this will go on like this pretty much for the next as well. When you look at your engineering budget guidance, it's up 20%, which is like $40 million and you only spent $7 million year-to-date greater than the year-ago. Secondly, there's been a resurgence in demand in the sugarcane sector of the business, which is high horsepower tractors. How much would you be willing to ramp production up in the back half of the year? Could you talk about production rates on a sequential basis both consolidated and by region? And I'm trying to get an idea if we collaborate the Centurion project, the investments in the AGCO production systems and the rollout of all these SCR engines from SISU, some of which would probably have warranty or a replacement costs as they displace Perkins engines, what kind of non-capitalized expenses might we expect on an annual roll-forward basis starting in '11 for this new, improved AGCO? Even with the lack of equipment, they still could generate pretty good results. We actually should expect pretty good commodity prices, core prices. And then can you talk about your outlook by region for production for the balance of the year? On the high horsepower tractors, as you mentioned, the mix is getting better and your share actually looks like it's up a few hundred BPS. Sunita Desai And from first quarter to second quarter production rates? It's more capital and development cost that drive these projects. And then the big improvement in our margins in the second half are due to the higher production volumes that we expect to do, particularly in the third quarter and also in the fourth quarter. We basically achieved more or less what we wanted to do and therefore optimistic that maybe we can save some engineering money for the remainder of the year. The percentage of small tractors, this might change so what I think is more [indiscernible] (34:08), in theory the high horsepower tractor business could recover. We do have more engineering expenses in the second half that will help pull down that margin somewhat. Peter Chang Credit Suisse Quick question on North American orders. And I guess specifically, if you could address in that your raw material and sort of input cost assumptions in the second half. It looks like it's doing pretty good, which was only surprising because you have a competitor who continues to launch more new high horsepower models down there. I'm just trying to kind of get maybe a little more granular on Western Europe because I think you said that things are stabilizing there, your order book is up I think you said 25% and yet you’re slightly decreasing your overall view of the market there. Sunita Desai And can you talk about your inventory levels by region? And we have a very good market share with our Valtra equipment in that customer base."

These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A weaker geographic mix, lower levels of production, increased material costs and higher operating expenses contributed to the decline. We will make forward-looking statements this morning including those related to projections of earnings per share, sales, market conditions, margin improvements, commodity prices, the impacts of currency translation and acquisitions, new product development and market expansion, factory productivity, plant investments, production volumes, free cash flow, depreciation, emission requirements, product line expansion, general economic conditions, pricing benefits, engineering expenses and capital expenditures. Higher prices for grain and dairy farmers in Western Europe and improved farmer sentiment are expected to generate market growth of about 15% compared to weak levels in 2010. The benefit of increased production volumes, material cost control, pricing and leverage over operating expenses, resulted in the improvement. As we look to the end of 2011, commodity prices remain at very high levels, a positive sign for farm income and farmer sentiment this year. We are projecting 2011 sales to range from $8.5 billion to $8.7 billion. Recall that in the first half of 2010, we managed through weaker market conditions in the U.S. and Western Europe, and were focused on inventory reduction. In the second quarter of 2011, operating margins improved significantly in North America due to higher sales and production along with cost control initiatives as you can see on the next slide. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2010 and 2011 are illustrated on Slide 4. Second quarter of 2011 operating margins also benefited from higher levels of production, pricing and improved leverage over operating costs compared to the second quarter of 2010. Compared to the third quarter of last year, we expect higher sales and gross margin improvement to be offset by increases in engineering and market development expenses as well as a more normal tax rate. Even after covering the increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting positive free cash flow for 2011. We plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. This year, we operated our factories at normal seasonal levels during both the first and second quarters. In addition, our strong operating performance translated into nearly $200 million of free cash flow for the second quarter of 2011. In 2011, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, improve our factory productivity in Germany and make investments in China and Russia. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that the actual events or results may differ materially. We Introduced profitable new products, reorganized our sales organization, lowered our logistics cost and improved the efficiency of our factories. At the end of June 2011, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was as follows: Tractors were at 4.9 months, 4 months for combine and 8 months for hay equipment. We anticipate modest growth in North America as the strong financial position of row crop farmers and the projection of farm income above historical averages is expected to support strong demand. For the full year of 2011, we expect production to be up approximately 9% from 2010 levels. Sales growth in Australia, New Zealand, Eastern Europe and Russia produced the increase. North American net sales increased approximately 5% excluding currency translation impacts during the second quarter 2011 compared to the same period of 2010, with our dealer inventory de-stocking efforts complete, sales of sprayers, high horsepower tractors and combines all showed improvement in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. Margins were improved in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the same period of 2010 due to higher sales and production volumes, better pricing and a richer mix of products. AGCO's second quarter cash flow of $193 million, which generated from elevated sales levels and improved margins and covered a $76 million-increase in capital expenditures. Increased production levels in our European and North American factories were partially offset by lower production volumes in South America. Sales of high horsepower tractors remained at an elevated level but declined about 3% compared to the strong levels in first half of 2010. Higher commodity prices and improvement in the Dairy and Livestock sectors contributed to the growth. AGCO's second quarter and first half 2011 tractor and combine production was up 8% and 14% compared to the same periods in 2010. We expect production volumes to be up modestly in the second half of 2011 versus the comparable period in 2010.","So are we talking apples to apples, you've actually increased the tractor capacity outlook or is it -- is there really that difference between the tractors and the transmissions? The factor of what our engineering investments are, investments in new markets and things like that, are the variables that we work -- we'll need to work through on our planning process for next year and the years to come. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO There's a few factors here that -- one is that factor Greg just talked about, where we aren't looking at a little higher material costs inflation that's, we've been -- I think, did a great job here in the second quarter, somewhat holding off, but we still see that coming. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO From -- our used equipment and our dealers, the levels are at normal levels as the percentage of new equipment, so all that looks okay. The -- we had some negative impact from strange -- yes, political situation in Argentina with a cap or they want to cap your imports to Argentina to the level of last year, and another cap would be that you only can import as much as you export. And then as we talked about earlier, we added some pricing in the second quarter to help us catch up with the material cost increases that we're seeing. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Well, one is that, Fendt is the clear market leader in the high horsepower segment. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes, the price increases are probably a little as a percentage, probably -- usually on the -- still the high- horsepower 5 to 10%, I would say that, that's probably still the right range but probably on the higher end of that, just because the -- you're talking about smaller dollar sales products and so the percentages look a little higher. But as we move into the back half of the year, we're going to see our material prices increase. Can you just give us an update on how you're thinking about greenfield versus acquisition and over what time period can we expect capacity to come on line? So overall I think it's -- the demand for farm products, for commodities will be higher than supply for many, many years to come, my guidance more [ph] for the next one 100 years. So we expect maybe to be more break-even-ish in terms of our pricing versus material inflation in the third quarter. And those are second half for the year loaded and it will impact us a little but they're very important for us to do, particularly in the engineering side, to meet the Tier 4 requirements and to keep our product development plan going. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO I -- well, actually I'm not aware on any special activities of competitors or you think that's just something... Andrew Burris Obin BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Well, I mean, Deere hosted a huge event for analysts in Europe, highlighting the significant push in Europe, CNH hosted a big analyst day in Europe at their Belgian facility, highlighting their increased focus on combines. You have your new products; how are they going to stack up against some of the other guys who have been pretty aggressively rolling out larger, higher horsepower products? And then as soon as we know the demand, we then plan capacities. So that means the big -- we have already the capacity increase in part of the factories, so the transmission plant is already finished and working. And then as you talk about how that's covering our material, for the first half of the year, we've done a very good job in terms of how those price increases are keeping us whole we're actually favorable, probably in terms of a margin impact, probably 1.5% to 2% on our price increases versus material inflation. We showed some of bigger tractors at farm shows in order to find out what does the market has to. So they could do something like 8,000, 8,500 combines a year and the rest of the investment is most probably -- most of it is greenfield. And therefore, I don't think that we will face major capacity restrictions. The size of the tractor, that's not only driven by the size of the farm, but also by cost of labor. So if you would go into a 2-set operations and you can increase it, their number might be based on 1/5 conservative approach. And across our factories, we're making significant upgrades to the quality and the other machinery that we have in the plant. So that means even on the big farm, traditionally in Brazil, we still use maybe smaller tractors compared to the U.S. because labor is cheap and you put 2 or 3 drivers on 3 tractors instead of using one very big one. We also see renewables from farms, produce used in other industries. So we have plenty capacity advantage, if needed. This year, every -- in terms of the market, in terms of our market and demand being able to accept those price increases than we don't expect any changes as we continue to roll out Tier 4 on the lower horsepower items. And especially in the third quarter we talked about how we're going to see material inflation, maybe actually catch up with some of the pricing we've already done. And also the mix is a little worse in terms of brand and horsepower ranges than what we had in the first half. The assembly factory transitioned, or let's say the new factory will start to work after the summer shutdown 2012. And then the second reason why we improved is our margin improvement project, where we showed quite some substantial improvements. Jerry David Revich Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And Andy, you mentioned the Russia production facility. We also see a little lower production in the second half, if you compare that to where we were in the second quarter, in the first half. The other element that we want everyone to understand is that we are ramping up engineering expense, as well as some of this what we're calling market expansion and additional marketing expenses in the second half. And then as we get the benefit in the fourth quarter of the pricing we put in for that material, as we worked through our order boards, we'll get back on the right side of it in the fourth quarter. I guess I'm a little puzzled because as recently as last month some of the press releases were still saying 20,000 tractors, but 28,000 transmission units. My -- let's say, I would rather expect a greenfield approach maybe with some Russian participation to be on the safe side, or a small Russian partner and it's on a big acquisition, but it's too premature to talk about it. And also the market development side, we got a lot of new products coming out and also we're very -- as Martin said, we're very optimistic about these markets in China and Russia and we want to do what we need to do and get started with continuing to market our products there. Second, Fendt's capacity this year, we will produce around 15,000 farm tractors. And that should be about $25 million if you look at first half versus second half of engineering increases as well as probably about $10 million to $15 million in terms of these additional costs for the market work that we're doing, that is in Russia, China also some additional marketing activities in North and South America as well. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO The tractor capacity will be 25,000, that's the number and I think it could be more. The reason is advanced technology, higher profitability, lower cost, lifetime cost of our product and much lower fuel consumption, so I'm not worried at all about Fendt's position in Germany. Overall, in Europe, the focus is on distribution on our internal organization. As we go through our plans for the next few years, we still have -- we see opportunity to improve the margins through a lot of work in our factories in terms of how we're -- in terms of material cost savings and also new products. Jerry David Revich Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Andy, you've had a strong rollout of interim to your 4 high-horsepower tractors, can you talk about the extent of cost increase you expect on under 175 horsepower tractors that you'll be transitioning next year? We see renewable fuels. We're looking at a -- putting in an assembly operation in Russia and also have plans for investments in China as well. Mark Koznarek Cleveland Research Okay, and then a final one, just to ask a question about capacity. We have, or we are in the middle of a major investment in that factory and the capacity will be up to about 25,000 maybe even more towards 30,000 tractors from end of 2012 on. I guess on previous calls, Martin had spoke about some potential opportunity to buy some existing capacity out there. We have all products which is needed and we are in very good connection with our dealers and farmers, so they will be -- to us it would be good if it would go into a higher horsepower in the future. When we look at 2012, we're still in the planning stage but certainly have a lot of plans to continue to make significant investments. There we -- as you know, we are in the middle -- we acquire -- want to acquire a combine manufacturer with quite a nice volume, which will help us to be in the market a little earlier. And from what I understand, the pricing is holding up and staying fairly steady. And the -- let's say, when we were hit 2009 or in the middle of 2009, first we were hit late and then second, this has really nothing to do with our industry and our industry suffered much less than other industries, which is also a sign that seemed to be strong fundamentals when you compare from commodities also 2009 and 2010, that is better than those of the other commodities and also our industry wasn't hit as much. The low hanging fruit's probably been cleared out, but with some growth in the business and we're starting to see some improvements in our result in the higher horsepower segment of the market that will also help us from a mix standpoint. Mark Koznarek Cleveland Research How much overall capacity is going into place just across all of your facilities for 2012 versus 2011? Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division And then -- and just the end market kind of commentary, can you tell us anything about what you're seeing in the used equipment part of the market in North America? But in general, our incremental margins should continue to be steady or improve as we work through our cost reduction activities and projects that we have in place. Can you talk a little bit about that, Martin, is it supply constraints or capacity constraints from Fendt, is it really something that you're watching carefully or is it just explainable as something that's temporary in nature? Martin, you made a comment a little bit earlier about Fendt capacity going up to 25,000 or 30,000 tractors."

Core margins were up significantly due to higher sales and production and favorable sales mix and cost control initiatives. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. GSI, our new grain storage and protein production business, performed well in its seasonally strong second quarter. Slide 9 highlights our inventory and receivables position at the end of the second quarter. The benefit of increased production volumes, a favorable pricing environment and only modest inflationary pressure around materials accounted for most of the margin improvement. Including significant planned investments in our -- and product development, market development and start-up costs associated with our manufacturing projects, we expect to continue to improve growth and operating margins from 2011 levels. Second quarter 2012 production was up 5% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Slide 11 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by or used in operating activities less capital expenditures. Higher soft commodity prices are expected to produce healthy income for European grain farmers in 2012 and are expected to keep demand stable. AGCO forecast for tractor and combine production volumes for 2011 are illustrated on Slide 4. We are closely monitoring the impact of the ongoing drought in the U.S. on GSI's North American grain storage and protein production businesses. We expect to generate strong cash flow again this year and plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering these increased strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow to exceed $200 million during 2012. The combine market was down significantly compared to the second half of 2011 due to the timing of industry production and due to very high levels of demand experienced in 2011. AGCO's use of cash in the first half of 2012 was elevated compared to the first half of 2011 due to our higher inventory build in our increased schedule of capital projects. The order board in South America is up about 20% compared to June 2011 levels. We'll be making forward-looking statements this morning, including projections of earnings per share, sales, demand, government financing programs, market conditions, farm incomes and production, commodity prices, margins, currency translation, pricing increases, productivity, investments in product development, facilities and expanding markets, inventory and production models, acquisition impacts, completion of facility construction and upgrades, industry demand, general economic conditions, engineering efforts, depreciation, free cash flow, supplier issues and capital expenditures. We expect production volumes to be up modestly for the remainder of the year. In September, we expect to start our production in the new assembly facility at Schengen [ph] Marktoberdorf, Germany. While order books are still healthy, we are closely monitoring the impact on orders in the second half demand from the severe drought being further caused much of the U.S. corn belt. Better harvests in Russia and Eastern Europe in 2012 are also expected to produce strong growth in these markets. In North America, the solid financial position of row crop farmers and the outlook for farm income above historical averages is expected to mitigate some of the impact of the drought that will reduce crop production this year. We anticipate the benefit of new products in our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. AGCO's order board at the end of June remained in very good shape. Our forecast includes expenses associated with site and manufacturing start-up and market support costs amounting to about $20 million for Fendt and $20 million to $25 million for expansion into China. And for the full year of 2012, we expect production to be up approximately 10% from 2011 levels. The expectation of lower crop yields plus uncertainty around industry demand in the second half of 2012. In 2012, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements are expected to cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 10% to 15% or $40 million. Our dealer month's supply in North America was as follows: tractors were 6.5 months, 5 months for combine and 6 months for hay equipment. At the end of June 2012, our North America dealer month's supply on a trailing 12-month basis was lower for hay equipment and higher for combines and tractors versus the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.08 and reflected both strong execution and the benefit of higher production volumes. Favorable exchange impacts, improving pricing and higher sales volumes produced the increase. Our order boards remain healthy, and we are projecting 2012 sales in the $10.1 billion to $10.3 billion range. We expect the increased capital expenditures to be in the $375 million range and our free cash flow to exceed $200 million after funding the expected increase in CapEx. Sales growth in Australia and New Zealand produced most of the organic increase. Both our Europe, Africa, Middle East and North American business delivered operating margins in excess of 12%, and our South American margins rebounded to 9%. In North America, industry sales of high-horsepower and utility tractors both increased due to higher levels of farm income in 2011. Every year, our operating plan includes an increase of dealer and company inventory required for the selling seasons. High-horsepower tractor and combine production was about flat with the second quarter of last year in North America and Europe, but production of lower-horsepower tractors were up. North America high-horsepower tractor and combine orders are down about 5% compared to June 2011 levels. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual results may differ materially. The inventory build in the first half of 2012 was attributable to normal seasonality, as well as the accelerated production schedules in Europe and some supplier delivery constraints. In 2012, we expect to increase our capital expenditures to approximately $375 million as we continue to work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity and complete the expansion at Fendt and establish assembly capabilities in China. In Europe, the order board is down about 10% from very high levels at the end of June 2011. We expect to reduce inventory by the end of 2012 as we complete our plant improvements and work through some supplier issues. The production schedule in Germany was more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year to compensate for lower production during the third quarter when the new assembly facility will be brought online. Acquisitions generated about half of the growth and higher sales in Brazil due to improved crop fundamentals were partially offset by declines in Argentina. We project the GSI acquisition will be accretive to 2012 earnings per share by about $0.45, and the strengthening U.S. dollar is expected to negatively impact our 2012 EPS by about $0.40 per share based on the current euro and real exchange rates. Increases in hay equipment sprayers and high-horsepower tractors produced most of the growth.","I worry about GSI, given that it's both protein production and grain storage, neither of which are likely to be in very healthy conditions by the end of the year versus your livestock business on the tractor side. And we can offer GSI some manufacturing space, which will not change our cost position in total sales situation in Russia and some other markets. Of course, we do business here in the open nature, so that means not everything we are doing can be 100% controlled. We monitor retail activity. So we compare our order board here in this presentation to last year. We need capacity in some of our factories. And then we monitor dealer inventory levels. I guess, I've been hearing from some suppliers, for example, Annexer [ph], reported this past week. You talked a little bit about cost control. Ashish Ravi Gupta CLSA Americas, LLC, Research Division Just if we take a step back, and I think about the long term, is it fair to say you kind of become more bullish on the next 2 to 3, 4 years for equipment demand? So the production levels are the highest in the second quarter. The big project for 2013 is the manufacturing facility in China, and most of the spending for that project is in 2013. You get a good picture, if you talk to tire guys, to hydraulic manufacturers and so and so. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO We still have probably 4 to 5 months of orders in North America and Europe. It starts to be ramped down in the third, and then the fourth is relatively low production and industrial activity there. So I think I reflected about our position already a little bit, and I would like Andy to make the legally right statement in order to keep me out of jail. And I don't mean across all cycles and everything. Or have used equipment prices changed? You mentioned that the tick-down in pricing -- just interested to hear how that's kind of trended relative to your outlook for material cost for the balance of the year. They're very productive. But just given the production sort of timing, especially with respect to Fendt in Europe, did you give us any sense of what the margin trajectory third quarter, fourth quarter we should sort of expect? Should I take that to mean that you're expecting orders to recover as we move closer to harvest in the northern hemisphere? So we're getting a good differential between how we're managing material cost and what the pricing is. We have some of our suppliers who have capacity issues, and that is also a reason why then we have some inventory problems here and there. So overall, my discussion includes, of course, suppliers. There was another supplier who on the axle side, so -- I mean, within Europe is it still very much south versus north. Robert Cameron Wertheimer Vertical Research Partners, LLC I just had a curious question on the strong high-horsepower tractors in the U.S. Is that specifically tied to a particular subregion or strategy or brand? And that's a very strong year because prices go up and on the other hand, also, input prices go down. And particularly in high-horsepower tractors, what do you think the risk is of order cancellation? So we still have the opportunity to move CapEx up and down to some extent, but our projections are that it will be in the same level at least in 2013. Because in our portfolio, we have the best-performing, high-horsepower tractor in the world. The higher CapEx part of that, just the lower ending stocks tend to sets up for multiple years of high production and sort of catching up with consumption. Your payments are kind of back-half loaded this year. And I can add now in the meantime that also a lot of the chemical industries try to replace crude oil derivatives by organic products. The Challenger is the brand, which is exclusive to our Caterpillar distribution network. Michael E. Cox Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division My first question is just trying to reconcile the qualitative commentary around your bullishness around 2013 versus the down year-over-year order boards at the end of June. Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Just going back to the higher dealer number -- inventory numbers, can you comment -- are you seeing any change in used equipment? So they will generate excellent profits this year. Most of AGCO's customers benefit very much from the much higher commodity prices. We're seeing not much pressure on material cost. I'm rather optimistic. And certainly, what -- that's what drives all of our business planning as the sale to the end customer. And also, when you talk to suppliers, you have to understand where are their main markets. Things kind of got back to normal, and we've been doing a great job in terms of managing material cost in Brazil. So that means, overall, I am personally very optimistic about the future of farming globally. And therefore, we decided to take the most important elements, which are -- which is basically the dry strength, the transmission and the rear axle and in many cases, also our diesel engine into the Challenger brand of tractors. Because obviously, we -- there's no benefit in increasing our level of inventory to our dealers. We talked to suppliers, but you need to understand where they do business and what is the nature of their business overall. So all those are critical factors in determining what our production and sales forecast should be. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO What we do have -- basically, we try to have about 20% to 30% term labor in our factories, which makes us very flexible. And also, I think the other advantage we have, in some of those markets, we already invested in manufacturing. We want to see that flowing through the customers -- end customers. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Andy, what we always do in these situations, whether the market is going up or down, is we monitor certain things very closely, certainly orders. So if you compare to a normal average order book we have in a very good year, we are still doing fine. So the dealer inventories are in good shape. And so we'll be monitoring that very closely, looking at our order boards. This is where some of the local manufacturing companies like Landini and Sami [ph] might be hit, but we are -- they are pretty much in the sector of high-horsepower tractors. Or what you're watching to initiate production curtailment actions? And so what you see is in the third quarter, they start ramping down production. Have you heard already positive sort of sales/order indications as generally commodity prices have been driven up? And with only a little investment, we basically can grow that export business substantially. And if there's adjustments up or down, we'll continue to do that in the normal course of our activities. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO And the main driving factor for us [indiscernible] just very important component for us is the automotive industry and with their production going down globally. And last year, our order books were record high. I think a lot of the factors there are the key increases in some of our most profitable products like high-horsepower tractors, sprayers and hay equipment were driving that improvement. This is a company who does most of the business in Italy for Italian manufacturers, smaller and bigger ones. I think this was a normal situation, and we needed also in some of our area and some of our products' order book to be a little lower because we just couldn't cope with it. And then on the Fendt side, where we have start-up costs relating to the movement into the new assembly operation, you have more like 70% of those costs in the back half, primarily in the third quarter. As I said, some of these was due to sprayers, which is really a first half product line; hay equipments, very strong in the second quarter. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO We don't see, first of all, higher dealer inventory numbers in general. And then in the context of your disclosure on the good backlogs and some of the products in North America, if the conditions continue to decline and for whatever reasons, farmer investment starts to decline as well. And just on the GSI breakdown, can you remind us what the -- you gave the sales split between grain storage versus protein."

We are successfully increasing margins through purchasing actions, factory efficiency projects and new product development. In 2013, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expenses of approximately 15% or about $50 million. Sales increases experienced in the professional farming segment produced growth in sprayers, combines and high horsepower tractors. Performance against our working capital target is also on track, and we are positioned for another year of strong cash flow generation. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes are illustrated on Slide 4. A large portion of the increase will occur in the second half of the year due to the low production rates experienced during last year's ramp-up in the new facility. The outlook for improved grain production in the U.S. this year is generating stronger demand for storage and conditioning equipment, and we have increased the forecast for GSI sales in the second half of the year. We expect total AGCO unit production for the full year of 2013 to increase between 6% and 8% as compared to 2012. As Andy Beck will discuss in more detail, we have increased both our earnings guidance and our forecast for free cash flow. GSI sales were down approximately 4% in the second quarter and first half of 2013 compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the timing of protein production equipment sales in China. The strongest growth came from the high horsepower segment, due to the healthy income levels for local farmers. In 2013, we expect to further increase our capital expenditures, as we work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in China. We also look for new products in our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. Our SG&A expense will include expenses associated with manufacturing sites start-up and marketing support costs, amounting to about $10 million for our Chinese operations. Europe/Africa/Middle East operating margins were up over 70 basis points in the second quarter of 2013 from the same period in 2012, due primarily to the higher production and sales levels at Fendt, partially offset by higher engineering expenses. Longer term, the global trends of population growth and changing diets are generating demand for additional grain storage and protein production capacity. Second quarter 2013 production was up about 7% compared to the second quarter of 2012. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. I'm also very pleased to tell you that we achieved record production volumes at our new Fendt assembly facility in Germany in the second quarter and reached significantly import productivity levels. Our third and fourth quarter margins will also benefit from favorable cost comparisons due to Fendt assembly plant start-up costs incurred in the back half of 2012. Operating margins expanded nearly 90 basis points in the second quarter despite the negative impact of market development expenses and higher engineering expenses associated with Tier 4 requirements. We expect to generate strong cash flow again this year and plan to continue investing in our plants and new products. In addition, AGCO's focus on margin improvement produced operating margins over 10% in the second quarter. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash from operating activities less capital expenditures. We are projecting 2013 sales in the range of $10.8 billion to $11 billion. Strong growth in France and Germany, largely enabled by Fendt's improved production capabilities, generated most of the increase. The negative effects of last year's drought on U.S. grain storage sales in North America have now lessened. We also expect an increase in inventory at the year end, as we build the necessary transition stock ahead of Tier 4 final introductions during 2014. We expect to increase capital expenditures to be in the $400 million to $425 million range and free cash flow of approximately $200 million, after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures and higher inventory levels associated with the Tier 4 product transition. Sales growth and improved profitability produced record earnings in the second quarter of $2.15 per share. Margins benefited from higher sales and production volumes, limited material inflation, pricing and cost reduction initiatives. This countercyclical nature of the protein production sector also supports more stable earnings in GSI. Growth in China and East Asia produced most of the increase. As we discussed last quarter, our full year Fendt production is forecasted to be higher than in 2012. Our third and fourth quarter European sales and income will benefit from Fendt's higher production levels. Favorable exchange impacts, cost-reduction benefits and higher sales volumes produced the increase. As Martin mentioned earlier, North America's operating margins exceeded 15% in the second quarter of 2013 and were up over 230 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2012 due to higher sales, a favorable sales mix and cost control initiatives. We generated solid sales growth across all of our regions despite challenging conditions in certain markets. The production growth was strongest in South America, with more modest growth in our North American and European factories. Favorable exchange and financing rates, improved weather and attractive soft commodity prices have energized the market in Brazil. We also expect improved gross and operating margins from 2012 levels after significant investments in product development, market development and start-up costs associated with our manufacturing projects. At the end of June 2013, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was approximately 5 months for both tractors and combines and 7 months for hay equipment.","Can you talk about how much was sort of mix -- I mean how much was mix and then sort of the operational improvements as well? Andrew Millard Casey Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Isn't that what a process industry means? Jerry David Revich Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And Greg, in the comment that you made earlier on the North America manufacturing improvement, driving the variance this quarter, can you just give us an update on production rates out of the Jackson facility and give us an update on which additional projects are you shifting around or producing more in North America? So we are in the process of announcing a joint venture in Russia, so that will happen somewhere in late August or early September. And it could even generate some additional demand for smaller tractors in the small tractor -- for small farm segment. And what we also like is that this business comes not only with the self-propelled sugarcane harvester but also other equipment. Have you -- do you have an early order program here in North America? Most of the used equipment goes depending on the size. Andrew Alec Kaplowitz Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division So Martin or Andy, maybe if I can press you a little bit on the order book in terms of quantifying sort of what's going on. We come in with a complete new generation of combine harvesters. So you're probably -- in Jackson, as we talked about last year, we're now assembling our high horsepower tractors. Or maybe ski gear, they are very cyclical because they sell mainly in winter. Well less cyclical, I guess. And you know, for me, I always make the statement that the farm business and our industry is not cyclical anymore. And now the question is what do you plan in order to make sure that, that also doesn't happen in the future? So therefore, when you talk about cycles, rather talk to the car guys or the truck industry or people like that. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO No issues with used equipment in Europe. And so what we do there is that we're able to grow our production really, while keeping a lot of the labor down and not having to grow labor as quickly as we would have in the past. We sold especially sprayers and high horsepower tractors helped us, and that's just a function of the high income levels for the row crop farmers. And then also, Africa needs a very reliable, easy to service and handle a smaller tractor, and we are in the process of developing that product, as you might know, and launch it towards the end of this year, and in steps also during the next couple of years. Jerry David Revich Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And Andy, just beyond the reversal, in addition to providing higher capacity because of the automated processes that you added, I believe you are targeting $15 million to $20 million of cost savings. I presume a lot of the strength you're seeing is share gain, it's -- I mean, maybe I'm not sure how strong the markets in Germany and France are, but are you seeing more share gains as you have more production capacity? But overall, we manufacture to demand and not ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Two things: One is we don't produce ahead of demand; and second, I still believe that Europe sales are not over yet because we have, at the end of the year, a very important farm show in Germany called Agritechnica, and this is the biggest farm show in the world. So we're feeling good about our order board as it relates to the balance of this year. And maybe if you can give us any color on that, what's going on and more specifically in order books would be helpful. I would believe that the order program would probably be coming on a little later than now. Basically, we'll be back to normal productivity and profitability rates. We've seen improvement in the U.S. in terms of some grain storage, as well as protein -- more in the grain storage side in the U.S. And then internationally, we've seen some improvement in Asia, Asia/Pacific region, especially in China for the protein. And then in Eastern Europe, some of the retail finance programs come in a little late and people, farmers, are sitting there and waiting before they place orders. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO I would even make it more precise, from 2015 on because I think we have a lot of important projects in the pipeline. But in general, our orders in North America are very flat with the end of last year, but up significantly over where we were a year ago. So we, along with our competition, were unable to get the proper amount of units into the market to fulfill demand. And so you'll see some savings on direct labor going forward in North America, and that will help our margins on those products as we continue to assemble those here. It was not high horsepower tractors for big American farmers. In Argentina, what's happening was the market was severely limited a year ago because of these import restrictions that were placed by the government. I don't want to go into detail here because I think we have a pretty good competitive advantage, and I don't want to elaborate this strategy here over the phone. But I think we're on a great path and we are on a -- we have a great growth strategy. So essentially all of our newly remodeled 2, 3 years ago, I guess, and launched tractors are being assembled in Jackson. And then we also talked about, I guess, a month or 2 ago about some additional investments that we'll continue to make in Jackson that'll help us improve in terms of our efficiencies. So it's more about the loosening of the import restrictions, and that's getting us back to a normal market. Because I'm in that business for more than 20 years, and I wasn't facing any cycle. And then if the rates do end up going up materially, how do you think that would affect demand? So therefore, what matters is not only commodity prices, which are still on a pretty high level, but also what [ph] factors in our lower cost for inputs. So I'm wondering if you have any -- if you're hearing anything from your dealers or your customers regarding order books and so forth? So when you see what the demand is -- and it's countercyclical, as Andy Beck already mentioned. So as we continue to grow our production and increase our sales in Fendt, those productivity cost savings will emerge. And basically, what happens is this generates some additional demand. Certainly, we're seeing our production levels be at really normal levels now. And I guess, can you discuss your thoughts and plans for production relative to demand in Europe going forward? But also as the Fendt business continues to grow, hopefully we'll see the majority and the rest of that productivity gain. Because AGCO and the other competitors have taken steps to increase the local content, they have relaxed the import restrictions. There is obviously a volume aspect to our margins, our overheads run 10% to 15% of our cost of sales, and there's an element of that which is fixed. And so we are ramping up production. Or is it the processing customers? The demand with the processors is pretty regular in terms of their investments. And so from the standpoint of looking at pricing versus the material cost inflation, we were -- we cleared over 100 basis points here in the second quarter and would expect that to continue in the third and fourth quarter. And so our production and our sales are going to be higher here in the second half of the year than last year and higher than Fendt's history. And lastly, on material costs, those are coming in lower than expected across the board. CapEx, as you look ahead to 2014 with a couple of these big projects rolling off, should we expect CapEx to decline next year? I'm pretty optimistic that also next year will be a good year. So overall, I'm pretty -- first of all, order books are still pretty strong. We localize, we are in the process of localizing and not importing, localizing new, more advanced technologies in the country. And so that's going to impact margins if our production is down. And so we're still shipping most of the major components from Europe. We basically -- sugarcane farmers need like planters, like transportation equipment and so on. So most of the margin improvement that we're looking -- we're achieving is on productivity in our plants, it's on reducing the cost of our products through changing suppliers or renegotiating with suppliers. In terms of the impact, there's really -- in terms of expectations, there's no expectation that the rates are going to change materially. Actually if I can ask a different type of question, I guess obviously, people are still sort of concerned about where we are  in the cycle here. So you recently certainly heard about a certain input cost going down in the area of fertilizers and also pesticides and chemicals. We start at planning in October, and we will come to Wall Street in December and talk about it more in detail. Milk prices went up, and there's a lot of discussions about -- or around the idea that quality milk should be honored by higher prices. And then over to Europe, I mean, it seems like perhaps you produced ahead of where demand is or maybe in line. And then a follow-up question, just what you're seeing on the used equipment markets, both in Europe and North America. What we are doing is we are basically improving the product and bring it up to our quality standards. And so that's creating the productivity gain. Can you talk a little bit about the launch of those products and when those could be perhaps material? So does that mean we should expect to see increased production there as well? We did still have some inefficiencies in our Fendt operations throughout the second quarter. I think we indicated that the production was higher than ever in the second quarter and from a productivity standpoint, and we're reaching target levels now. There's still a lot of growth opportunities and a lot of demand on the on-farm storage. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Those were productivity rates. If some survivors, local survivors, local manufacturers, and then of course, one of our competitors is big in Italy. From a material standpoint, we saw very little cost increases, and we also have our initiatives going in terms of globalizing our purchasing activities, which is driving cost reduction."

For the full year of 2008, we expect weakness in tractors and that horsepower had continued growth in high horsepower tractor in the North American industry retail market. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, including some related to future sales, earnings, production levels, supplier and production constraints, inflation, foreign income, working capital improvement, cash flow, margins, effective tax rate, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. Tractor and combine production levels were up 11% in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2007. The graph on the right displays our annual free cash flow for 2007 and our projection for 2008. At the end of September 2008 our dealer month supply on a trailing 12 month basis in North America were as follows; five months for tractors, four months for combines, and five months for hay equipments. Globally, the markets are healthy and as I mentioned earlier our order boards remain strong. We'll be making significant investments in our future in the form of increased engineering expenses to support a growing list of new product programs, cost associated with our European system initiative, and spending associated with developing new markets and improving our distribution. I also am pleased to tell you that despite the challenges in the financial markets AGCO's backlog remains strong and we have not seen a significant change in the flow of orders. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We managed through significant material cost increases during the quarter and experienced no debt deterioration of our operating margins. Much of our working capital focus is now aimed at lowering dealer inventories in North America which have now remained at 2007 levels. Our South America business reported operating margins of 8.8% for the third quarter of 2008, the absorption benefits from higher volumes were offset by three factors first, raw material cost inflation which hit us hardest in this region; second, the negative currency translation impacts associated with sales of equipment manufactured in Brazil and exported to other countries in South America, and finally increased product development expenses in the region. If you recall, in the first half of 2007, sales of our premium price set tractors were unseasonably low due to supplier constraints and the shifting of production of our new high horse power tractor. Our current 2008 forecast calls for unit production of tractors and combines to increase 18% to 19% compared to 2007 levels in order to satisfy the forecasted increase in the market demand. We are working with our suppliers and focusing on key internal processes to meet our production schedules by the end of the year. Through the end of September our sales and margin growth is paying for these investments and generating improvement in earnings in 2008, compared to 2007. The elevated demand for industrial and farm equipment continued to put stress on AGCO's supply chain. While AGCO's total unit tractor sales were lower in the first nine month of 2008, AGCO's unit sales of tractor over 100 horsepower and combines both showed strong growth doing the first nine months of 2008. These maintained a high level of financial discipline and it's reflected on our balance sheet with our low level of net debt. The graph on the left side of the slide shows the free cash flow during the first nine months of 2008 compared to 2007. Slide 4 now illustrates our production schedules for 2007 and 2008. We also experienced declines in the 400 to 100 horsepower category. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. We believe AGCO, Your Agriculture Company, is well positioned financially, strategically, and operationally to serve our customers and execute on the positive long-term fundamentals of the agriculture sector. Despite absorbing material cost increases, operating margins of 6.8% for the third quarter of 2008 match those seen in the third quarter of 2007. The weakest segment continued to be tractors under 40 horsepower that are more closely tied to the general economy. Slide 5, details in that preview the farm equipments volume by region for the first nine month of 2008. The fourth quarter is the seasonally strongest when dealer and company inventories are sold down at the end of the year. The professional farming segment continues to benefit from positive cash crop economics and sales are up approximately 33% in the overrun in the horsepower tractor segment and the combine market grew approximately 25% in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. We expect to increase capital expenditures including additional investments and production capacity to be in the $230 million and $250 million range and our free cash flow to remain strong in the $175 million to $200 million range. Volume growth to market strength and new product introduction and distribution improvements, positive pricing environment and expense savings all contributed to the improvement. Even after recovering increased spending on strategic initiatives and capital expenditures for new products we expect to generate strong free cash flow this year. We are projecting 2008 sales to increase 22% to 24% driven by healthy market conditions, pricing, and positive impact of currency. Strong demand for our high horse power tractors and combines produced an increase in our sales of approximately 29% compared to the third quarter of 2007.","We're still getting leverage relative to the sales because of the strong sales growth we're achieving and holding our expenses down with the exception of you can see our engineering and R&D expenses were up as planned. We buy more steel related, steel components with steel content in them and so we're not subject to much of our cost to sales really related to locking in with contracts. We discussed with our General Manager just last week where we stood and we have not seen any significant... any real change to our order patterns, our order boards remains strong, they are up 30% to 40% over last year at this point in time. Mark Koznarek Cleveland Research Company Okay and then just a clarification on that comment earlier about the order book of 30% to 40%, is that a worldwide comment or specific to North America? We don't expect to see this year is more of a normal year and with this significant sales growth we're using working capital and as a result we still believe we'll have a very strong cash flow result but not to the level of 2007. Martin H. Richenhagen No, it's pretty much across the board with a major project in Kent [ph] because they put up more than we would have had more capacity and that is not related so much to the market because you know that Kent has a very advanced technology which by lets say the... by getting farmers more and more professional is actually more demand, more interested. So, most of this will roll in and roll out but you have to go back and renegotiate with suppliers and then have that reflected in the rolling out from the inventory level. When it comes to the financing, first of all as Andy mentioned already we offer our AGCO Finance solution which is used by a lot farmers in the U.S. Second the CAT [ph] guys... the CAT dealers have in addition to that CAT finance which is also available for farm equipments. Andrew H. Beck I think inventory levels will be up year-over-year because of the significant increase in sales that we are forecasting. But I would say that we still feel like we have a relatively flexible cost structure, we do now have an engine business but its only for about a third of our products that we're selling and so you know we're still focusing on staying as flexible as we can. Mark Koznarek Cleveland Research Company A question on raw materials. Martin H. Richenhagen In terms of orders? There is a requirement there and a little more inventory on the ground to achieve that. We focused on that is as one of our key initiatives to turn inventories and our accounts receivable, dealer inventories faster in North America, we've gotten those down significantly down more to industry average levels. We said that we thought we would start to see benefit from the lower raw material prices starting in the first quarter of next year. Andrew H. Beck Right Mark, as you point out and what we've said before, in the third quarter we did see pretty substantial increase in raw material cost and our pricing was somewhere between 4.5% to 5% and that was not completely sufficient to cover those cost increases. Mark Koznarek Cleveland Research Company Andy, with the way your purchase contracts are constructed would we have to wait until the second half to begin to see benefit or would it be earlier in the calendar year? Joel Tiss Buckingham Research So, two things, can you explain why are you reducing inventory levels and then your free cash flow is expected to be lower in '08 and '07? Andrew H. Beck My estimate is inventories probably about a $100 million. Ann Duignan J.P. Morgan Okay and the lagged impact because of inventory on the ground should be a net positive next year then as you work through that inventory? Terry Darling Goldman Sachs And Martin, in terms of the signal that you would need to receive to formally pull those down cycle leverage it would simply be orders turning down, is that fair? And then we've heard in the press that one of your peers was having cancellations of orders in Argentina, have you guys seen any material cancellation across the board? We have some of our guys going there tomorrow and they actually... you know that we are pretty close to the market and so I am not very scared to be honest because of course also in the last crisis in Russia there was always money to buy farm equipment and the Russians are very creative in how to organize deals and they pay them with lot of credits or cash or safe guarantees. Our order board if you look at tractors as ranges visibility of four to six months and combines more like six to nine months right now and that is substantially higher than where we would have been last year. Martin H. Richenhagen No, it's also that we have kind of pre warning system so to say first of all informally in way that we talk to a lot of farmers and to all our dealers frequently and then second of course we also use external expertise and people doing actually spots of interview and which let say that the helpline is customers satisfaction but we also ask this from about, are they willing and planning to buy and what are their investment plans for the next year so that means we've certain, we've a lot of information. Inventory exchange or through September compared to September a year ago, inventories were actually lowered by about $30 million because of exchange, because the rate started changing right at the end of the quarter. But typically the dividend is a little larger in the fourth quarter but we are getting cash flow every quarter from those joint ventures. Personally I'm rather optimistic about the markets and this includes also finance solutions. Market share in South America is up from 44 to 49 in September 2008 and basically in those areas where market share is down it's caused by a reduction of orders received from the sugarcane industry we are well trapped is very, very strong, reduced cost by one and those kind start to become a little careful because there are two professionals and secondly announced a new range of big tractors which they are expecting which reduced the market a little bit. We've done many studies recently on what we should... in our production facilities of what's core and non-core and we've been outsourcing a significant amount of parts in a few of our facilities particularly in Kent [ph] and Hesston, Kansas as a result of some of those studies and in order to be as nimble and flexible as we can to react to market changes. Some of those impacts are probably starting to see some positive foreign currency impact where typically we've been... its been a head win for us on the margin side as well as impacting as you say from finally catching up on the pricing versus our material cost increases that we've seen from the inflation on steel and some other commodities. We look at what all the portfolio needs and projection are and what cash can be released out to maintain our ratios that we have with that finance company. It seems like you have really managed to offset the raw material pressure presumably via price or other kinds of productivity initiatives I'm wondering if you can sort of characterize the impact of raw materials compared to your comment about price adding 5% to revenues, was raw material a similar amount and then where do we expect that raw material inflation to move into 4Q and then when does it begin to roll off in '09 with the commodity prices having fallen so hard? Jamie Cook Credit Suisse Hi good morning, my first question, you guys commented a little bit on your order book being up I think you said 30% to 40% but can you give us a sense of how much visibility you have into 2009 and how that would compare if we were sitting here last year at the same time? And then if I could just dive into Martin's comment about the political risk in Russia, have you seen any sort of impact on the order activity over there from that? And then is there a potential here that with the combination of pricing and currency that North America might snap back at least by '09 to a mid-single digit operating margin as it has enjoyed in past good cycles? Terry Darling Goldman Sachs Okay, that's helpful and shift the gears totally, Andy, I wondered if you can remind us what the cash flow sort of dynamic is with regards to the joint venture with Rabobank, is there a 4Q dividend and that's kind of it or is there cash dispersed on a quarterly basis, can you remind us on that? As you point out we are now seeing those raw material prices particularly steel prices come down. As we get into the fourth quarter, our pricing has accelerated over 5% and the cost due are also projected to go up as a percent as well but we think we will be covered here in the fourth quarter and we will not have any margin impact there. And I am expecting input cost going down, so that means I am not too concerned about farm income 2009. So that means it's a combination of we do things at certain expenses like for example research and development slowing down, certain capacity investments. But there is a lag there in terms of when those margins should improve and because you have inventory on the ground at the old prices with the old exchange rates. I think important is that we act very quickly, what we did in Brazil we are into the midst of reducing dealer inventories. The reason that our cash flow forecast is a little lower than last year, is that last year was a year where we've made significant improvement on reducing working capital, particularly in the North America business. Martin H. Richenhagen A lot of this productivity improvement we expect to lay out but also some capacity investments. Robert Wertheimer Morgan Stanley I am going to apologize for this question in advance, but when you say you don't see any significant change to orders what date is that coming through, roughly. What are the inventory effect year-to-date foreign exchange and in the third quarter?"

We have more work to do here and plan to underproduce projected retail demand for the remainder of the year. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements including some related to future sales, earnings, production levels, general economic conditions, currency translation impacts, farm income, working capital and its components, cash flow, margins, effective tax rate, interest expense, retail sales financing, pricing levels, capital expenditures, plant shutdowns and strategic initiatives. Lower production volumes and a weaker mix of sales in South America and Europe were partially offset by improvements in North America. The volatility in commodity prices and the expectation of lower farm income has contributed to a great deal of conservatism in farmers' equipment purchase decisions. At the end of September 2009, our North America dealer, month supply on a trailing 12 months basis was higher than the same time a year ago, but it's lower in all categories from where we were at June 30, 2009. While our North American operations continued to lag the performance of our other operations, you can see that this slide, that our operating income for the first nine months of 2009 has improved significantly from the same period last year. With the weak market demand we are expecting for the remainder of the year, we are projecting 2009 sales to range from $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion. We returned our Sprayer business through profitability by investing in product upgrade and moving the distribution to the CAT® dealer network. At the end of September 2009, the backlog was just under half the level we saw at September 30, 2008. Softer market demand in Argentina and Brazil and the shift in mix to lower horsepower tractors in Brazil drove most of the decline. The most significant declines occurred in the Sub-100 Horsepower Tractor segments, which are closely tied to the weak areas of residential construction and livestock production. We expect 2009 South American industry retail volumes to be down significantly from 2008 levels due to drivers of conditions and the impact of tightening credit on planted acreage and core production. In the third quarter of 2009, operating income in our North America segment declined compared to the third quarter of 2008 due to the significant drop in sales, production cuts and dealer destocking. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. The sales of high horsepower tractors and combines into the professional producer sector have weakened in the third quarter as forward commodity prices declined for most of the quarter and foreign income estimates were lowered. In the fourth quarter, we expect inventory reductions to outpace our stabilizing payables position. While the North America business was not profitable [ph] in the third quarter due to our production cuts and inventory destocking efforts, we expect full year 2009 operating income to improve on 2008 results. In the third quarter, we continued to execute our plan to cut production, reduce inventory and aggressively control cost. Our disciplined program to lower inventory levels has taken down company and dealer inventories by more than $165 million since June 30. While our 2009 results are very important to us, we are also focused on AGCO's long-term profitability, and we will maintain our investments in engineering and capital expenditures this year. Weaker sales, lower production volumes and increased engineering expenses focused on our high horsepower tractors and new harvesting products contributed to the margin compression. With the global recession, volatile commodity prices and lowered expectations of farm income, our order boards are weak and farmers are being very conservative. As a result, we expect reductions in working capital will contribute to cash flow generation in the fourth quarter. In response to the softening demand, our full-year 2009 production of tractors and combines is expected to be down close to 25% from 2008 levels. In addition, we have other initiatives in the pipeline that we believe will have a positive impact on North America results. Slide 4 illustrates our production volumes for 2008 and the first nine months of 2009 as well as our current forecast for the fourth quarter of 2009. Dealers are more conservative with re-orders, and they are less comfortable with the levels of new and used inventories. We plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. It also highlights the need we have to further reduce our inventory in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we will have additional temporary plant shutdowns on top of the normal maintenance shutdowns. Slide 5 details industry retail farm equipment volumes by region for the first nine months of 2009. In the third quarter of 2009, the Brazilian government introduced a new financing program for all equipment. While we made a reduction on our inventory since the end of June, our significant production cuts are resulted in lower accounts payables, which limited the benefit in working capital and cash flow. Softer market demand produced lower sales and the shift in the mix of products towards smaller, lower-margin, lower-horsepower tractors also contributed to the decline in operating margins. In the third quarter, production was cut by 31% compared to the third quarter of 2008. In the third quarter of 2009, sales declines, lower production volumes and a weaker mix of products compared to the third quarter of 2008 resulted in a drop in adjusted operating margins to 2.5%. South American industry yield for tractor volumes decreased approximately 22% during the first nine months of 2009 compared to 2008. We reduced assembly shifts at our plants in Brazil and Finland and reduced fabrication, welding and paint shifts at all our plants in Jackson, Minnesota and in Hesston, Kansas. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting improved free cash flow this year. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $200 million to $225 million range and free cash flow in the $50 million to $100 million range after funding of our strategic investments. The decline in operating margins resulted from weaker sales, lower gross margins and higher engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales. We are reducing our logistics cost with the use of our regional assembly centers and we've added more rigor to our pricing function to ensure we are more responsibly pricing our products. In Brazil, the mix of our sales is still rated towards smaller tractors but a new government financing program, which includes high horsepower tractors has helped to stabilize the market. Third quarter 2009 tractor incumbent production levels were down 31% compared to the third quarter of 2008. We lowered our production plan for Europe and North America and increased it for improvements in the Brazilian market. The softening global demand is evidenced in our order boards, which have declined significantly. Stronger market demand and an increase in third quarter production compared to the production in the second quarter of 2009 produced the increase. These production cuts will have a significant impact on fourth quarter sales and earnings. Tractors were at five-month supply, combines were at five months and hay equipment was at 7.5 months. Working down our inventory levels remains a top priority. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Industry retail tractor sales in Brazil decreased 2% in the first nine months of 2009 with the Brazilian government financing plan for small farms and a new financing program for all equipment helping to stabilize the Brazilian market.","Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO I'd say more of the dealer inventories where we're high and hay, when you look at finished goods inventory, it's really across the board. And then my second question, on the inventory front again in the quarter, did we build inventories in Brazil in the third quarter, for AGCO specifically? Daniel P. Dowd Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division I notice that sequentially, it appears that your repair parts inventories actually were up a little bit. Second, we work on several projects which are a little bit more long-term like getting to a stronger distribution network without facing a lot of legal problems. We redefined the core processes of those factories. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO If you look in materials and purchasing on a strategic initiative context, cost country sourcing, and this is a major project on how to move components to suppliers with more favorable conditions. So we have a lot of things going on and therefore, I am pretty optimistic that at least this is the target. Is it more from government programs or is it waiting to see industrial production get better? Joel Tiss Lehman Brothers Can you give us a sense in 2009, the underproduction relative to retail demand. Dealers are still not ordering at a very rapid pace in Europe, and so order board is relatively low right now, which indicates that they still would like to see their inventories continue to come down. Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your inventory situation in Europe, yours and your dealers. You're now talking about the order book being down so I think the order book will stay pretty much on that level or hopefully will go up again. Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Could you address the fact that your backlog has been 50% versus year ago and your inventories are still too high. Daniel P. Dowd Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division So as you shift to higher levels of production when demand starts to return, do you expect similar kinds of incremental margins to what we've observed on the downside or do you expect more traditional incremental margins? Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division I wonder if you can help us frame some of the cost cuts that are seemed to be accelerating with the employee reductions and how they might flow through for next year, and as well as whether you expect to get some tail wind on lower input cost next year? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Yes, good news in a way that it looks like that some of the European markets, France is a big market, so the biggest farm equipment or let's say the biggest farm market in Europe is France. That this is not just a short-term improvement but a long-term adjustment of our North American activities. If the demand is flat, how much do we add back to 2010 earnings just to produced in line with retail? In terms of capacities, what we're doing is lowering our direct headcount and certainly working on our indirect overhead costs as well, but we're confident through bringing back employees, bringing back temporary or contract employees that we could ramp back up if demand improved in the future. This year, they saw on the mid part of the year a fairly substantial drop in commodity prices, little concern about their input costs. This has just been started this year and I am expecting some long-term improvements coming from this major activity. One of your competitors earlier this week, last week, basically indicated a 50% down experience in combines and high-horsepower tractors. It's not just all about the factory but certainly, as we go back up, we would expect that we would be able to hold our overheads and try to get as much falling to the bottom line from that additional production. Andrew Casey Wachovia Securities I just have a detailed question on the order board in North America. But I wondered if you could maybe cite what you think are the one or two most important causes for the improvement in the operation income in North America and comment on how sustainable these are. Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division The input cost, whether you... Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO We've done a pretty good job getting our, it's particularly on steel, getting that back in line from that big increase as we saw in 2008. But based on our projections, I wouldn't expect a significant amount of benefit carryover into next year. Henry Kirn UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Wondering if you could chat a little bit about how much of the capacity cuts you would view as permanent and how much you would need to ratchet back up when demand ultimately returns? We have installed a AGCO improvement system in order to make sure that we collect input from our people in order to improve our manufacturing processes. And then the other part of the business that now goes to our CAT® distribution network is our Sprayer business, in North America, and that has -- Charlie to answer your other questions, one of the key elements of our improvement in North America is the return of strong profitability versus Sprayer business and the reason for that was moving the Sprayer business through our CAT® distribution network. So if we can get our inventories back in line in the future, then we would be able to produce more at a steady retail level. Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division Just to make sure I understand that, year-to-date, free cash flow down $312 million but you still expect to generate $50 million to $100 million for the full year. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO There are some sectors that we feel like we'll probably have to make some adjustments in the next year, particularly on Baylor's or hay equipment in North America, probably inventory levels in certain regions in Europe. I'd say our South America inventories are much better in line now. It's certainly a major challenge for us, and we've got our production pretty much set now. I would advise you to look more at the year-to-date rate and project that forward. Because if AGCO sales are flat and you've under -- I'm just trying to figure out if we've really underproduced enough, what's the likelihood that we get up earnings in 2010? Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division How much comp for those do you have that you will have rightsized your inventories by year end? What will get them back buying again I think is confidence in their income levels, seeing the commodity prices higher and looking for more productivity in their farms. Andrew Casey Wachovia Securities So if I extrapolate what you just said, Martin, you would expect order patterns to improve from where you are right now into 2010? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Actually, as everybody in our industry, most of our equipment needs to be redesigned. So buying engines ahead, producing equipments ahead and things like that. The year 2010 will be a little interesting in a way that you need to make sure that you do the -- it takes the right decisions with regard to the things you can, but you are flexible. Joel Tiss Lehman Brothers Can you also just help us understand, last question, where the finished good inventories are, both by products and geographically as well? You're seeing the operating margins and so, the operating leverage over your engineering and operating expenses can make a significant difference in what you see following to the bottom line. And so that France takes a lead in order to support farm and certainly, will also be supportive of us. And in that environment, do you think given the production cuts that you've taken that you can actually be up in 2010 on the earnings front and with some of the cost initiatives that you've done? As I mentioned before, we are already have identified a few pockets like hay equipment, where we think we'll be producing under but we got to finish or detail plans before we can give anymore guidance there. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO We are doing a lot of cuts here throughout the year this year so there should be some carryover impact into next year, particularly on some of the cuts we made on our operating expenses, operating costs, as well as overheads in our factories. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, certainly, we believe that there are initiatives through our new products and some of the things we're working on in terms of factory productivity, full-year impact. So it's production absorption and leverage over operating costs which causes those fluctuations. So we expect dealer inventories to decline more in the fourth quarter, and we would hope that we would be better in line by the end of the year. So we'll be looking for that to help us a little next year but we've got to work our way through our budgeting and process to really be able to quantify that for you but there is going to be an element of that. Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division But you did say that your order board in Europe is much lower than your overall order board right now."

While demand continues to be weak in Europe, order flow from our dealers stabilized and the order board in Europe was up significantly at the end of September 2010 compared to the very weak level at the end of September 2009. We expect gross margin improvements to be partially offset by higher engineering and pension costs. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. Our latest outlook for 2010 anticipates a slightly more optimistic view for the South America market, with no change to our view of Western Europe and North America. South American order boards remained strong but were slightly down by 25% from very high levels at the end of September 2009, and down about a third from the end of June 2010. Strong crop production was still an attractive financing program supported by the government contributed to strong market demand. Our dealer month supply in North America was as follows: Tractors were 4.9 months, combines 5.5 months, and seven months for hay equipment. Increased production and the shift in the mix of products towards larger, higher-margin tractors also contributed to the improvement. Improved crop production and increased credit availability contributed to improved results in Argentina. Higher level sales and production in the fourth quarter in both regions are expected to drive the improvement. We're expecting strong free cash flow in the fourth quarter from our seasonal reduction of inventories. In the third quarter of 2010, operating margins improved in North America due to higher sales and production. At the end of September 2010, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-months basis was lower for tractors and hay equipment compared to the same time a year ago. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. In fourth quarter, we expect lower production volumes in South America relative to the strong levels in fourth quarter of 2009. North American and European factories also experienced production increases in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. Compared to the end of June 2010, orders in Europe are flat. Third quarter 2010 operating margins in AGCO's Europe/Africa/ Middle East region dipped [ph] (33:23) down sequentially due primarily to seasonal plant maintenance shutdowns. Equipment order boards in North America also increased from September 2009 levels. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect to increase our capital expenditures, as we work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line and improve our factory productivity. AGCO's tractor and combine production increased 35% compared to the third quarter of 2009. We are projecting 2010 sales to range from $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2009 and projected volumes for 2010 are illustrated on Slide 4. As a result of stronger cash flow results for the first nine months of 2010, our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of September 2010 was significantly better than at this point a year ago. This year, we have been investing for future growth in the form of higher engineering expenses and additional investments in our plants and new products. In the South America region, operating margins rebounded to 11.1%, an increase of over 400 basis points for the third quarter of 2010 compared to 2009. In 2010, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 15% or $30 million. With our dealer inventory destocking efforts complete, sales of tractors, combines and sprayers, all showed improvement in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. North American and European production is expected to be higher than the weak levels in the fourth quarter of 2009. These earnings per share projections excluded restructuring expenses expected to be incurred in the company's European operations, estimated at approximately $0.04 per share for the full year of 2010. Margins were improved in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to higher sales and production volumes, partially mitigated by increased engineering expenditures. Our factories operated at relatively normal production levels in the third quarter of 2010. We also look for our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved margins. The benefit of increased production volumes and material cost controls was partially offset by increasing expenditures for engineering and other initiatives. Stronger sales and higher levels of production generated over 200 basis points of improvement in the third quarter operating margins compared to the third quarter of 2009. Strong market demand in Brazil and improved conditions in Argentina produced higher sales in both countries. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we're targeting free cash flow in excess of $100 million for the full year of 2010. The first-half production cuts and inventory destocking efforts in 2010 brought our dealer and company inventories of new equipment to targeted levels in both of these regions. Slide 8 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. The High Horsepower segment benefited from favorable row crop economics and increased 12% compared to the first nine months of 2009. We slowed the investment in some of our plant productivity projects and new products in the last year in response to softer market conditions in Europe. We will make forward-looking statements, including some related to projections of earnings per share, sales, market demand, gross margins, market share improvements, investments in facilities and new products, productivity and purchasing initiatives, effective tax rates, inventory levels, free cash flow, production volumes, industry demand, global food demand and diet trends, commodity prices, farm economics and productivity, pension costs, and engineering and restructuring expenses.","Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO I think for the most part, dealer inventories are in reasonable shape. Andrew Burris Obin BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division So basically the margin improvement is, right now, is all operational, and things are getting better in North America, right? But obviously, with our order board down, we are seeing that the market is starting to, I would say, come off of these record levels a little. Markets remain very strong, and they have extended the PSI program, which is the low-interest program through March, but there's still a little uncertainty in the market about the availability of that program going forward and I think that's impacting some of the order board softness that we're seeing compared to the, really, the extremely high levels that we saw a year ago. All our small tractors below 100 kilowatts, which is about 125 horsepower on one common platform globally, and the components for those tractors will be localized in China, which makes us very competitive in this business outside China like in South America, North America and also Europe, and create a platform which can also be used for a local assembly and helps us to get into the local Chinese market. Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Would you attribute any of the improvement to the AGCO production system and if so, how much? Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division The comments about the Western Europe order board being up significantly, is it possible to frame that, relative to a more normal year kind of where we are today versus not up versus last year, which was quite weak, but just on a normalized basis? Could you give us a sense with how much of North American production is made in North America, right now? That's not all projects but kind of things like projects, some increases in overhead through wage increases, things like that, that impacted the results. So it kind of seems like either the production mix is kind of weak or maybe there are some startup restart costs that maybe had not been anticipated. Mark Koznarek Cleveland Research And then finally here, when we look at fourth quarter, your production forecast for 4Q is roughly flat year- over-year. In Russia, I think they cannot stand much longer not to invest in farm equipment anymore because they have already problems this year. Did you say that orders are down 25% year-over-year? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO The reason for this is more efficient engineering and not any kind of delay in project. Peter Chang Credit Suisse Well, with the government financing extended into March of 2011, could you give us some thoughts or initial thoughts on how you think that might impact 2011 with the context that your order book is down about 25%? And also, to your point, we are including some project expenses in our results for really this quarter and next quarter relating to the major changes to our assembly processes in some of our European plants and some other projects that we have ongoing that are taking up some costs that you'd normally probably see a little more leverage. Barry Bernard Bannister Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division And then on South America, yes, your order book is down, but you said last quarter that you expect an improvement in the mix towards a higher margin and higher horsepower on down units. Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division I think you have said that destocking was essentially over, does that mean that the used equipment inventory has basically flushed through at this point? Used inventories in Europe is still, I would say, are on the high side, but manageable at this point. I was wondering if you could talk about your investment in the region and your outlook for the agricultural equipment market in the region? Mark Koznarek Cleveland Research A question about the production increase, up 35%, so close to double what the revenue increase is, and your margins typically respond pretty significantly to the production rate increases or decreases. We're also seeing some little bit of pressure on material costs in that region as well, and we're working hard to offset that. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, Andrew, about 70% of our business in North America is domestically produced."

These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. We will make some forward-looking statements this morning, including those related to projections of earnings per share, sales, market conditions, margin improvements, commodity prices, farmer income and sentiment, industry demand, the impacts of currency translation, plant and product investments, production volumes, free cash flow, depreciation, emission requirements, product line expansion, general economic conditions, pricing benefits, capital expenditures and the impact of the GSI acquisition including projections regarding integration, synergies, retention of key customers, demand for protein production, infrastructure and grain storage and cash generation. With a business model similar to AGCO's manufacturing, dealer distribution and ag market focus, GSI will be a good fit to integrate into AGCO's operations. The benefit of increased production volumes, pricing and leverage of our operating expenses was partially offset by increased material cost and higher engineering and marketing expenses. Higher prices for grain and dairy farmers in Western Europe and improved farmer sentiment are expected to generate market growth of about 10% to 15% compared to the weak levels in 2010. We wish to caution you that these statements or predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. A weaker geographic mix, lower levels of production, increased material cost and higher operating expenses contributed to the decline. AGCO's free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2011 of $83 million, improved about $150 million from last year and covered a $100 million increase in capital expenditures. GSI is a strong, profitable, very well-managed ag equipment company that serves AGCO's retail customers. In the third quarter of 2011, operating margins increased about 55 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2010 due to higher sales of -- higher levels of production and improved pricing, partially offset by higher levels of engineering expense and increased material costs. AGCO's order board for the North American and EAME markets at the end of September 2011 is double the level at the end of September 2010. AGCO will be able to improve GSI's operations in the areas of purchasing, manufacturing and international market expansion. Lower production volumes in South America were offset by increased production levels in our European and North American factories. Improving income levels, changing diets and population growth in these regions are expected to drive the need for more protein production infrastructure and more grain storage. For the first 9 months of 2011, AGCO's free cash flow improved more than $150 million. AGCO's third quarter 2011 tractor and combine production was flat compared to the same period in 2010. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2010 and 2011 are illustrated on Slide 4. Even after covering the increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting positive free cash flow for 2011. Sales of combines and high horsepower tractors showed significant improvement in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010. Margins were improved in the third quarter of 2011, compared to the same period in 2010 due to higher sales and production volumes, better pricing and a richer mix of products. We plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. At the end of September 2011, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was as follows: tractors were 5 months; 4 months for combines; 6 months for hay equipment. In addition, GSI's track record of strong profitability and cash generation improves AGCO's overall capacity for investments to support the long-term growth of our business. In the third quarter of 2011, operating margins improved in North America due to higher sales and production, along with cost control initiatives as you can see on the next slide. In addition, our strong operating performance translated into improved cash flow. Sales growth in Russia and Australia produced most of the increase. This acquisition is consistent with our long-term strategy of providing productive solutions for the professional farming sector. With industry demand below peak levels in Western Europe, our EAME region produced record third quarter sales on a constant-currency basis and improved operating margins by over 350 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2010. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the $250 million to $300 million range, and our free cash flow to remain positive and exceed $150 million after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures. We expect production volumes to be up 8% to 9% in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the comparable period in 2010. For the full year of 2011, we expect production to be up approximately 9% from 2010 levels. Sales of high horsepower tractors remained elevated and were up slightly from the strong levels in the first 9 months of 2010. We introduced profitable new products, reorganized our sales organization, lowered our logistics cost and improved the efficiency of our factories. In 2011, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet Tier 4 final emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our German manufacturing facilities and make investments in Russia. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Farmers are progressing with their harvest and commodity prices remain at attractive levels. The combined distribution network of our 2 companies allows for greater access to customers in all major markets for both AGCO and GSI. Modest growth is expected in North America as the healthy financial position of row crop farmers and the projection of farm income above historical averages is expected to support strong demand in the professional farming sector. Higher commodity prices and improvement in the dairy and livestock sector contributed to the growth. We are projecting 2011 sales to range from $8.7 billion to $8.8 billion. South America order boards remained strong but were down from very high levels at the end of third quarter of 2010.","We don't expect headwind for 2012 because we are in a very close relationship with most of our suppliers, so they know what we plan and so they know the volumes we are expecting. The pricing did not cover the material cost inflation that we're seeing in the market. We have ramped up engineering expenses as it relates to Tier 4 compliance and new product introductions, as well as some of the -- what we call a market expansion and market introduction of new product expenses that are occurring in Eastern Europe, some in Asia and in South America as well. Are you seeing any build-up of used equipment inventories in Europe at this point? Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division Andy, on your Slide 4 here, where you talk about tractor and combine production. Timothy Thein Citigroup Inc, Research Division I just want to come back to the earlier comments on the -- you mentioned the order boards being double the level of a year ago and I believe, you said North America and Europe. And so in North America, they have a very strong established distribution network and obviously, we have a very focused distribution network as well that we're improving and we're very positive about. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Fortunately, we don't have much higher inventory. So that means everybody is working on controlling, the inventory is much better than in the past in our industry. And then from August on, we are let's say, we are in a position to benefit from the capacity improvement. Henry Kirn UBS Investment Bank, Research Division And with accelerated depreciation incentives in the fourth quarter, is that an opportunity to gain share in North America, if you guys have a little more inventory than some of your competitors? As we looked at that one last quarter, I think we expected third quarter production to be up quite a bit year-over-year, and it turned out to be fairly flat. Can you just elaborate on that as well please? And some of these developing markets in central, west portion of Brazil, we believe can help us grow particularly the grain storage side of the GSI business. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO But overall, the high horsepower markets are strong in most of the markets. So that's all... Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO For 2000, the emissions requirements for the Tier 4 interim for horsepower is over about 175 horsepower kicked in at the beginning of 2011. So just questioning, is that a function of supplier not being able to ramp production? Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division Was there anything in the third quarter North American production that came in a little lighter than we thought? I can say in the tradition of AGCO, which is that we just start our planning process for 2012. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Also, Larry, I believe that used inventories and overall inventories, or dealer inventories are in better shape than when they were in 2008, end of 2008. What pulled the margins down was some additional operating expenses primarily in engineering was ramped up as well as some marketing and product introduction expenses that were a little higher than where we were last year. When it comes to suppliers, no major issue right now. Just -- you can tell why I'm asking because obviously, there's a price increment on the Tier 4 compliant equipment. And maybe touch on the -- or elaborate on the distribution synergies. And then also, what are your order boards look like over there right now? Are you seeing any flow through whatsoever from the macro uncertainty, any difficulties in financing? So some they put in some capacity, some planning did improve and though we had problems in the past, we also went for dual sourcing and developed different sources. Deere's been talking a lot about disruptions to manufacturing, the inability to pass through price on Tier 4 on small and medium-size tractors. So we're still on track to meet the unit demand, the unit production and unit sales that we had forecasted. So I believe it was just some change in timing between some of the South America production that was a little lower than what we had expected. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Stephen, overall, supply base this year is in pretty good shape. As far as capacity improvements are concerned, we will have the -- Fendt has 2 projects completed next summer, so the transition will be done during the summer shutdown. Are there other effects, maybe some positive ones on exports? Let's say the truck industry is a very special segment, they also were -- they're directly related to supply and demand and basically also consumer goods. And in times when the real does weaken, since those export sales out of Brazil are oftentimes denominated in dollars, we do see margin improvement for those exports sales. The planning will be completed end of November and then when we come towards it in December, we will talk about 2012. So are those -- is that equipment Tier 4 equipment or the equivalent that's in the high horsepower? And actually the farmers in Brazil benefit more from a weaker real since they export a very large percentage of their crop. In terms of distribution synergies, most of the ones that we're highlighting, we believe, are likely to be outside of the U.S. So markets like Brazil, where we have a very strong distribution network and a very active group. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations We do benefit, as Andy was talking about earlier, we do export some of the production from Brazil to the, well, to the U.S. in some cases, but also to some of the other South American countries like Chile and Peru and in better times, Argentina. You'll see for high horsepower a much stronger Tier 4 mix in 2012. Obviously, on equipment financing as we've experienced even back in 2009, there was sufficient financing in the market in Western Europe to finance farm equipment. If I could just one more, is you mentioned a few times how the high horsepower market is strong. We have had some minor issues with suppliers from here and there, but really hadn't affected deliveries of equipment at this point. And then obviously, major markets, North America, Europe, our order boards are up pretty much across the board. And where are you on the capacity expansion plans? Are you guys having any kind of near-term supplier issues? Then lower production and a weaker mix of products as well impacted us as we pointed out. We have the components in-house, labor cost, it's very much known. So that means the year is almost over, we know what orders we have in-house, we just need to deliver."

Including significant planned investments and product development, market development and start-up costs associated with our manufacturing projects, we expect to continue to improve gross margins from 2011 levels. We project the GSI acquisition will be accretive to 2012 earnings per share by $0.35 to $0.40. Core margins were up significantly due to higher sales, a favorable sales mix and cost-control initiatives. Even after covering the increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow to exceed $150 million during 2012. In September, we opened our new Fendt assembly facility in Marktoberdorf, Germany. We are facing a once-in-a-generation drought in North America, but lower yields are being mitigated by higher crop prices and extensive insurance coverage for row-crop farmers. However, the lower levels of crop production have reduced the need for additional storage, and our grain storage business is being pressured in the U.S. With the impact of the drought in the U.S. on GSI's North America grain storage and protein production businesses, we are reducing the projected full year EPS contribution of GSI to $0.30 to $0.45 per share for the full year. Our forecast includes an increase in costs associated with the start-up and ramp-up of production at our Fendt tractor facility. We are projecting 2012 sales in the $9.8 billion to $10 billion range. For the full year, the impact of start-up costs and lower productivity during the ramp- up period throughout the fourth quarter is estimated to be approximately $25 million. Earnings per share forecast was reduced since last quarter to take into account lower sales expectations at GSI in North America due to the impact of the drought, lower sales projections in Europe due to weaker Northern European market conditions and the impact to sales and margins of the slower ramp-up of production at our Fendt tractor operations. South American order boards were flat. The negative impact of Fendt's lower production, especially on our German sales, was offset by growth in France, Russia and Africa. Orders were down more modestly in North America as we begin planning to transition to Tier 4 final versions on certain products. AGCO's order boards at the end of September were down by about 30% compared to September 2011 in Europe due to weaker demand primarily in Northern and Southern Europe. The heavier inventory build in the first 9 months of 2012 was attributable to stronger sales, supplier delivery constraints and the slower ramp-up in the new Fendt assembly facility in September. And adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.96 and reflected strong execution despite lower production volume. We expect to generate strong cash flow in the fourth quarter and plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expenses and additional investments in our plants and new products. We expect production volumes to be up modestly for the remainder of the year. In North America, industry sales growth was the strongest for high horsepower tractors due to the healthy economics for row-crop farmers. In North America, the solid financial position of row-crop farmers and the outlook for record farm income is expected to mitigate most of the impact of the drought that will reduce crop production this year. We are being very conservative as we ramp up the new facility to ensure we maintain our high level of quality and as we make progress with our SAP implementation. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by or used in operating activities less capital expenditures. In 2012, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements are expected to cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 10% to 15% or $40 million. At the end of September 2012, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was approximately 5 months for tractors and combines and 6 months for hay equipment. Gross margins benefited from a favorable pricing environment, and we faced only modest inflationary pressure for the purchase -- for purchased materials. While higher crop prices are helping row-crop farmers, they are pressuring the margins for livestock growers, and our protein production business is also facing some short-term challenges. And for the full year of 2012, we expect production to be up approximately 4% to 5% from 2011 levels. As Martin mentioned, in the third quarter, we started to feel the impacts of the U.S. drought on our grain storage and protein production businesses in North America. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. Every year, our operating plan includes an increase in dealer and company inventory required for the selling seasons. Third quarter 2012 production was down about 4% compared to the third quarter of 2011. We also made progress with one -- with our strategic -- with one of our strategic production initiatives. Gross margins were impacted by costs associated with the start-up and low production at the Fendt facility in the third quarter. AGCO's use of cash in the first 9 months of 2012 was elevated compared to the first 9 months of 2011 due to our inventory build and our increased schedule of capital projects. Sales growth in China and Australia produced most of the organic increase. The new facility provides AGCO with the most modern, efficient and technology advanced agricultural tractor manufacturing transfer facility in the industry. Relative to last year, this was flat for tractors and hay equipment and higher for combines. Increases in high horsepower tractors, sprayers and hay equipment produced most of the growth. Acquisitions generated about 4% of the growth. As you know, the Fendt production schedule in Germany was more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year to compensate for lower production during the third quarter as we brought the new assembly facility online. We are forecasting modest growth in key Western European markets, offset by declines in Southern Europe due to dry weather and credit constraints and declines in Scandinavia and Finland due to wet weather and lower crop production. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking comments. We anticipate that our new products and our productivity and purchasing initiatives will drive improved gross margins. In 2012, we expect to increase our capital expenditures to approximately $375 million as we continue to work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity and complete the expansion at Fendt and establish assembly capabilities in China. Our new assembly process is designed to lower manufacturing costs and significantly increase Fendt's tractor capacity. Growth in the key markets of France, United Kingdom and Germany was offset by declines in Southern Europe due to dry weather and credit constraints and declines in Scandinavia and Finland due to wet weather and the late harvest. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $375 million range and our free cash flow to exceed $150 million after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures. We expect to reduce inventory in the fourth quarter as we complete our plant improvements and work through our supplier issues. Record farm income is being projected for the U.S., and demand for high horsepower equipment remains elevated. Lower level of production in North America and Europe were partially offset by increased activity in our South American factories. Higher soft commodity prices are expected to provide healthy income for European grain farmers in 2012, supporting retail demand. Favorable exchange impacts, cost- reduction benefits and higher sales volumes produced the increase. AGCO's forecasts for tractor and combine production volumes for 2012 are illustrated on Slide 4.","It's -- it primarily gets into the mix of production. But today, if you look at what we offer all the way from unloading the crops off the combine, conditioning the crops, and then getting it into the silo and monitoring and all of that, GSI provides that equipment, which is not very common if you look across the competitive landscape. This platform of tractors goes from about 130 horsepower and below, and they will be produced in China and exported all over the world, sold in all of our markets. Can you take a minute to reconcile for us your earnings versus production guidance? Looks like you expect production to be up sequentially but earnings to be flat. Because of the drought causing the yields to be so much lower, there was not a need for both conditioning equipment, which is one of the higher-margin pieces of GSI, as well as any storage business. So the overall mix is detrimental to production absorption as well as margins. So it was a combination of not just grain storage, so in terms of our lower outlook for this year, but also on the protein production side. I mean, so you're choosing to ramp slower, and I guess to make sure everything's running smoothly in quality, is there anything unexpected you saw when you sort of started things up, or are you just being cautious? I know you guys talked about how the order book was down considerably. How come [indiscernible] that the demand for grain storage and protein buildings may be under significant pressure, not just in the short term because of the drought, but longer term because of the absence of tax benefits, like Section 179? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, with the Fendt upgrade, what it -- the project enables us to do is 2 things. As you -- the weakness you called out here as we come towards the tail end of the year, do you feel those are delayed orders? And we're seeing down production, primarily in Europe, which is our much heavier manufacturing facilities and with some of our higher-margin products. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO So, guys, I think what we need to see, we are still in for the third record year in a row despite the slowdown at Fendt, and that is actually a very thorough approach because we need to make sure that we don't jeopardize the high level of quality at Fendt, and we need to make sure that we really do get everything done properly. But also there just wasn't as much -- because of the lower yields, there just wasn't as much grain to have to store. And is there any hiccup in production? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes, typically, the order from -- from order to fulfillment at GSI is typically just a couple months. That seems to be holding okay. One is to be able to produce at higher levels of volume in the future. And then could you go into sort of what was the price and material costs impact in this quarter and sort of how are you guys seeing that going forward? Or how does this work in terms of -- and through the distribution channel, is there -- does that create an inventory issue within the channel? Again, we have lowered our production rates, and the mix is much worse than what we would have seen last year because of the lower production levels, particularly at our Fendt business, which is our premium product and carries strong margins. In sort of the core North American high horsepower market, did you see the pattern that maybe some of us expected, where you saw maybe sort of lighter orders in the beginning of the quarter then sort of picking up as farmers saw their insurance payments start to come in or could start coming in? In addition, we've been very active in working on cost-reduction initiatives, pricing initiatives in order to reduce our product costs, focusing on material cost reduction and product design cost. And so we're not seeing new orders in that part of the business either. And it's a major project, so that's the -- not only that we did build a complete new assembly plant, but we also have a new factory layout and new software, and this combination, that, of course, adds complexity to the project, when we were slightly more optimistic about it. And we obviously have been able to ramp down inventories and our production, in line with what we see demand going forward. And as the drought continued to worsen, we just -- it wasn't a matter of orders getting canceled, but it was just a matter of not -- of new orders not materializing. And then we did feel some inflationary pressure for our materials. So from a production standpoint, that's helping us. And we offer already for a couple of years tractors made by our joint venture partners in India, TAFE, Massey Ferguson-branded, Massey Ferguson quality tractors to Brazil, so it's nothing we worry too much about. And do you see yourself having to diversify your grain storage business further into the supply chain over time to make your overall competitive offering more attractive? Andrew Alec Kaplowitz Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division Martin, you guys talked about orders being down pretty significantly in Europe toward the end of the quarter especially. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Yes, so this year, we've had I would characterize it as modest inflationary pressure on our materials, and that continued through the third quarter. And then in South America, we're looking for margins to be flat to slightly up as, again, sales and production look to be strong in the fourth quarter. And so we get cost reduction from productivity improvements, as well as the ability to meet market demand. And that does go back to selling, sales growth in some of our key high-margin businesses, where we're focusing our efforts in high horsepower tractors, sprayers, hay equipment. Overall, in Western Europe, I'd say that the orders are down between -- typically between 10% and 20%. And then the higher prices are obviously affecting protein producers at this time. So yes, so and as we talked about the -- there just isn't the demand for this incremental storage, Martin mentioned it. So as we work to start establishing ourselves in the local market, we're also working on our industrial capability to be ready to produce this new platform of tractors, which should produce better margins across the world and provide us with a very competitive product offering in China as well. As we did that change, we also designed the factory in a much more productive way, improving all systems and improving the flow of the manufacturing operations to where we will get, once we're up and running at stable production levels, should get an improvement in our productivity. And I think, in general, you will see GSI outperforming in the export markets quite a bit. We're building up not only our capabilities there in terms of sales and marketing, brand awareness, as well as starting the new facility that we're going to build the tractors in. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO No inventory issue at all. And if you even -- when you pull out GSI, the margin improvement is quite substantial for our North American operation. And then within that decline in order boards that you spoke of in Europe, could you perhaps call out what you're seeing in Western Europe by comparison to those other regions just so we have a sense for how that large region for you guys is performing in relation to some of those peripheral areas? And so what's happening is we're replacing -- we're seeing some growth in production in small equipment, particularly in South America, which is not a very vertically integrated facility that we have in South America. And so, yes, we did see some deterioration in the order flow that we were experiencing really up until kind of the middle of the summertime. So they don't carry very long, large backlogs. So I'm not expecting any structural change in Europe, and I'm very optimistic that also Europe will see pretty strong demands 2013 and the years to come. And then hopefully this isn't an off-the-wall question, but it seems like there's been a fair amount of M&A in the grain storage sector just very, very broadly around the world, with Archer Daniels buying GrainCorp in Australia. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Yes, Ross, as we talked about -- and I think Andy mentioned it earlier on the call, the typical order to delivery time and order board for that matter for GSI is much shorter than in our machinery business, it's only a couple of months. Vance H. Edelson Morgan Stanley, Research Division Could you just comment on the current development activities in China, in particular, what are the steps you're taking now, what are the next steps to take, and how long do you think it will be in this development stage before the current activities start to pay off? The -- as you're aware, the feed costs for the chicken producers and the hog producers are much higher, and so the profitability of those folks are definitely being pressured. It's pretty much more related to the fact that most farmers and those farmers who actually normally invest in grain storage basically sowed their crops already because of the high commodity prices, so -- and the big demand. How have orders progressed through the quarter and the visibility in that market as you go forward? When we tell -- talk about production, we're talking about units. So from a production and sales standpoint, we're seeing some upside there. But given that we're at such a weak level of activity already, can you kind of talk about how you think about the market structurally? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO So we have basically very early in time taken the right decision, and therefore, we feel very, very good about our engineering effort on the products we launch. And so we were effectively out of capacity in that facility and needed to make this major change in our production capacities. Can you talk more about where you stand on productivity enhancement opportunities in the U.S.? What you need to know is that India is a big market for tractors, but horsepower is limited by design to around 70, 75, which means that those players basically address the small farm segment. As we're doing that, we are in later stages of the development of a new platform of tractors that will be produced in China. And then on the grain storage and handling side, there's always additional piece parts and components that we can add to the process that will enrich our products. So the order book is down from previous year or from last quarter, but it's still on very high and robust level."

Europe/Africa/Middle East operating margins were up over 130 basis points in the third quarter of 2013 from the same period in 2012, due primarily to higher production and sales levels, partially offset by higher engineering expenses. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. We managed our seasonal working capital requirements very closely this year and are in a good position to generate strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. Third quarter 2013 production was up about 7% compared to the third quarter of 2012. The countercyclical nature of the protein production sector supports more stable earnings in GSI. In 2013, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expenses of approximately 15% or about $50 million. At the end of September, AGCO's order boards were up in South America and down in North America and Europe. Growth in China, Australia and New Zealand produced most of the increase. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes are illustrated on Slide 4. Sales increases experienced in the professional producer segment generated growth in grain storage equipment, sprayers and midrange and high horsepower tractors. We expect total AGCO unit production for the full year of 2013 to increase between 5% and 7% as compared to 2012. AGCO's purchasing actions, factory efficiency projects and new product developments are all contributing to our improved profitability. We expect active end of year retail activity, which should support order flow in the fourth quarter. We expect improved gross margins and operating margins from 2012 levels after significant investments in product development, market development and start-up costs associated with our manufacturing projects. Margins benefited from higher sales and production volume, limited material cost inflation, pricing and cost-reduction initiatives. In terms of inventory metrics, at the end of September 2013, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was in the 5 to 6 months range for tractors, combine and hay equipment. AGCO's strong cash generation will allow us to invest in our plants and new products and continue returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. We are projecting 2013 sales in the range from $10.8 billion to $11 billion. We also look for new products in our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. Longer term, the global trends of population growth and changing diets are generating demand for additional grain storage and protein production capacity. Our fourth quarter margins will also benefit from favorable cost comparisons to the Fendt assembly plant start-up costs incurred in the back half of 2012, but will be partially offset by lower production end levels in other European facilities. Attractive commodity prices, favorable financing rates and a weaker real all contributed to the strong demand in Brazil. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. U.S. grain storage sales improved in the third quarter compared to last year's drought-impacted results and accounted for most of GSI's third quarter increase. North America's operating margins exceeded 11% in the third quarter of 2013 and were nearly 190 basis points higher as compared to the third quarter of 2012 due to increased sales, a favorable sales mix, particularly related to high-margin GSI sales and cost control initiatives. As we have discussed throughout the year, we expect an increase in inventory at year end as we build the necessary transition stock ahead of Tier 4 Final introductions during 2014. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash from operating activities less capital expenditures. Our 2013 capital expenditures will remain elevated as we continue to work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in China. Sales declines in Central and Eastern Europe and the United Kingdom were offset by growth in Germany and France, largely enabled by Fendt's improved production capabilities. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the $400 million to $425 million range and free cash flow in the $200 million to $250 million, after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures and higher inventory levels associated with Tier 4 product transition. As we discussed last quarter, our full year Fendt production is forecasted to be higher than in 2012. Slide 8 details GSI sales by region and by project -- product. Sales growth and higher margins produced record earnings in the quarter of $1.27 per share. Our SG&A expense will include expenses associated with manufacturing start-up and market support costs, amounting to about $10 million for our Chinese operations. Production was down slightly in Europe, where strong growth at our new Fendt assembly facility in Germany was offset by lower production levels at our Massey Ferguson and Valtra factories. The production growth was strongest in South America, with more modest growth in our North American factories. Global demand for farm equipment remains very healthy, but conditions vary widely across the developed ag markets.","No real change in market dynamics or anything else, just a little timing on some of the major projects. So the inventories build up at this point in time and then will come down throughout the rest of the year. Ross Paul Gilardi BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And how do you feel about your own inventories and your dealer inventories right now? Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Going back -- sticking in Europe, can we talk about the, I guess, is there any more granularity on the order book? And so it, therefore, typically, before Agritechnica, orders slow down a little bit. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations So we have seen a pickup in the midsize tractors for some of those dairy and livestock guys and also with that, we would expect to see heavier orders or continued heavy orders for the hay products. And then if you could give a little more color on the mix in the North American orders that you saw in the quarter? So early order programs and the like are going on right now, so it's little too early to draw any conclusions from those. The trades have been talking about just a little bit more aggressive incentive activity. Ashish Ravi Gupta CLSA Americas, LLC, Research Division Martin, I'm just wondering with the balance sheet sort of now almost fully delevered after GSI and the strong free cash generation, it's been a while since you've announced the deal, I'm wondering how the M&A pipeline looks? Or are you seeing or hearing from your dealers that they are experiencing some slowdown in order activity? I think the fact that the inflation pressures on material costs are allowing the market not to have to discount -- not to have to price as much as maybe what we've seen. Of course, we are lean, we are comparable -- much leaner than some of our big competitors. This is now the most modern tractor assembly factory in the world. Going forward then, as we complete the plant in China, we'll start production next year. I think when you look at ex-currency sales were down a little bit and the comparisons were relatively easy because of the Fendt production issues in a year ago. And did you have any inefficiencies in the Fendt facility this quarter or have you guys generally worked all those kinks out? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO No inefficiencies whatsoever, so we are doing fine. And it's an ongoing challenge to stay lean. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Well, the -- one main reason was that we invested in some of our factories and productivity and efficiency increased pretty much. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Well, you saw that our sales and production are -- absolutely, there's no reason for headcount reduction. You obviously maintained your full year outlook for North America even though tractor volumes are up 12% year-to-date. But generally, we'd characterize it as a solid order board. So we're expecting the activity levels in our dealerships and retail demand to be strong for the balance of the year, and that's what we're for focused on right now. And we expect to have -- be very -- have high productivity in the fourth quarter this year with substantially higher production than a year ago in the Fendt facility. For GSI, I think it's more positive because if you are a farmer, you basically think about whether you would like to sell your harvest later, so that means you might invest in grain storage. Michael Shlisky JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division It's Michael Shlisky, filling in for Ann. It's not as much of a flow business, but very large projects, particularly in Eastern, Central Europe, and just the timing of some of these projects. And you will maybe see more of those productivity gains in the future. Jerry David Revich Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division I'm wondering if you can talk about how we should expect the, I guess, efficiency profile for the Fendt facility to track heading into next year. There's a lot going on, especially in the U.S. with some expiring tax benefits and the farmers have had a very good year, a good harvest in most cases and commodity prices have been okay, so farm income is going to be good. We would expect to see sales volumes increase, although most of the production for that factory is going to be in the other regions, so you won't see it all showing up in Asia Pacific region. Thomas Alan Gilloran Jefferies LLC, Research Division And question on inventories. On prior upgrades, you've been able to continually prove your throughput though we call it a year or so after the transition. Ross Paul Gilardi BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division You took your production down just a little bit for 2013, I think from plus 6% to 8% to plus 5% to 7%, why was that? But the situation is that we have a good order board in almost all our product lines. I think it's -- our order board, I would call, is pretty solid right now in North America. Are you still targeting production at the Fendt factory of about 18,000 units for this year? So as we move into next year, it should be still smooth sailing and we're looking for more opportunities for productivity as we move forward, just like we do in all of our plants. Can you give us an operational update on where the facility stands? We're just starting getting orders for next year into the system. I know you've got the fully operational Fendt facility, positive mix probably because of France and Germany, so just trying to get a sense of how margins will look year-on-year as we move into the fourth quarter? In Europe, our business is much more project-driven. But we don't believe that'll have a material impact on demand. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO As we've said, our dealer month supply is about 5 to 6 months on most of our -- in our U.S. dealer inventory levels. Obviously, the commodity prices are down, but also you have to keep in mind that farm income levels are projected to be very strong in North America and South America. And so, those productivity improvements, of course, come in every quarter, so to say. So there is some offset then as you see maybe a slowdown if you do on the row crop guys, the dairy and livestock and the protein producers typically see their margins go up and that's when we would expect to see stronger sales of those products that we just talked about. Then just on the Tier 4 inventory buildup. They'll come down as we have -- we expect a very active year-end retail activity as we always do. Steven Fisher UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Wondering if you could just talk about how your order intake on the final Tier 4 products has been since they were introduced. And then I guess if we look at Agritechnica 2 years ago, and if I remember correctly, it was a big boost for the order board. So we're continuing to see pretty rational markets and we are seeing some discounts, as you would normally see at the end of the year, as you work on your inventories. We shut our factories down in August for maintenance 2 or 3 weeks typically for most of the factories, so that influences demand or influences production, which is typically down 10% to 15% sequentially from the second quarter. Is this have anything to do with the late harvest and perhaps some of the order activity that you typically saw kind of in the last couple of weeks or month or so get pushed out towards later in the end of the year? I wanted to ask you if we could get a little more color on the order boards in North America."

However, AGCO unit sales of tractors over 100 horsepower were high-end 2007 compared to 2006. Free cash flow for the full year of 2007 improved to $363 million. We'll be relying on sales and margin growth the pay for these investments while generating an improvement in earnings in 2008 compared to 2007. We didn't experience any extreme issues as we finished 2007, but we are working with our existing suppliers to prepare them for expected demand levels and they also working to qualify new suppliers to mitigate further supply constraints. In North America our dealer inventory month supply has improved for tractors, combines, and hay equipments. Increased sales of high horsepower tractors, bailers and hay equipment were responsible for the increase in the fourth quarter. These documents discuss important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. On slide 4, you can see our production schedules for 2006 and 2007. We used our well positioned plans to leverage very healthy market conditions and produced strong results in the quarter. For the first quarter of 2008 sales growth has expected to be in the 15% to 20% range, and while we are projecting full year 2008 EPS growth in the 10% to 20% range, we expect first quarter 2008 EPS growth in the 40% to 50% range. In the fourth quarter AGCO's supply chain continued to feel the stress produced by the strong global demand for industrial and farm equipment, and we see some of that also this year I guess. At the end of December 2007 our dealer month supply on a trailing 12 months basis were as follows; approximately five months for tractors, four months for combine, and five and half months for hay equipment. We saw a strong margin improvement in our Vlatra and Fendt brands, which both have been experiencing growth in the high horsepower's tractor segment. In North America our record farm income produced an increase in our sales of nearly 30%. For 2008 we expect a record level of U.S. farm income in 2007, and continued high commodity prices in 2008 to produce continued growth in the North American market. Our account 2008 forecast calls for production of tractor and combines to increase 5% to 8% compared to 2007 levels, in order to satisfy the forecasted increase in the global market demand. We've posted a record quarterly sales, record earnings and record cash flow. Production for the North American region was below retail demand, and we saw further improvement in our dealer inventories at year end. The interest savings were generated by debt refinancing, lower debt levels, and increased interest income earned in 2007 compared to 2006. In both Europe and South America our production matched retail demand during 2007. The highest growth rates secured in the over 100 horsepower segment. We finished 2007 with production of tractors and combines of approximately 20% compared to 2006 levels. Slide 5 details industry retail farm equipment volumes by region for the full year of 2007. Before we get started this morning, let me remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, including some related to future sales, earnings, production levels, supplier constraints, farm income, working capital improvement, cash flow, and strategic initiatives. We are projecting that 2008 will be another year of strong free cash flow even after covering our increased investments, and receiving a smaller benefit from our working capital initiatives. However, as a result of our focus working capital management that began in 2006, inventory levels ended 2007 approximately flat with last year when you exclude currency impacts. We are projecting 2008 sales to increase 11% to 13% driven by pricing, strengthening markets in North and South America and Eastern Europe, market share improvement, and the impact of currency. First, currency impact associated with sales of equipment, manufactured in Brazil, and exported to other countries in South America. Sales in Argentina increased approximately 65% excluding currency where higher commodity prices have improved market demand. In 2008 we'll be making significant investments in our future in the form of increased engineering expenses to support a growing list of new product programs, cost associated with our European system initiative, and spending associated with developing new markets and improving our distribution. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in our $190 million to $200 million in our free cash flow to remain strong in the $175 million to $200 million range. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual results may differ materially. Operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year of 2007 were up from 2006 levels due to sales growth, improved product mix, and cost control initiatives partially offset by currency impacts primarily in North America. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Strong volume growth in our South America business produced operating margins of 9.3% for the full year of 2007 an improvement of approximately 240 basis points compared to the full year of 2006. We were encouraged by the progress made by our dealer inventories and with our strong sales growth. Tractor and combine production levels were up 27% in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Slide 8, reflects the progress we've made and reducing our investment in inventories and receivables. Globally the markets are very healthy, and our order books remains ahead of where we stood at this time last year.","I know the assumption that also I was... that we wouldn't face problems on the supply chain. And the first is our raw materials were trending where you thought they would be when you issued your preliminary thoughts on 1.5% to 2% pricing or are they higher? We are going to expect that situation to again occur in 2008, where we don't expect to see significant improvement in the earnings in North America all because of currency you know, currency is going to impact us probably in the $30 million to $35 million, if you look at where the exchange rates are today, and the fair amount of that is in North America, and so as a result we are making improvements in the base operations of the company in North America, but are struggling to offset the currency, but we'll try to keep it flat to maybe a little better, just continue to reiterate that currency that although it impacts our North American operation they are offset primarily in our Europe, Africa, and Middle East business where we are getting the benefit of currency translation on the stronger Euro versus the Dollar on our European profits, as well as we are starting to see more and more of our product that's exported from our U.S. plants into Europe, and they are enjoying better margins on those products, so they are particularly bailers and some combine. So for the full year I think we would expect to have some, you know, produce under retail again, but in the first you're building your dealer inventories and then they get sold through throughout the second half. If that were to take effect with accelerated depreciation and a higher limit on Section 179, could you guys take up production to meet stronger demand in back half of the year in the U.S. or are you at capacity limitations right now? So if you recall in 2007 we had a kind of a normal... a lower than normal sales level in the first quarter, and then we caught it back up primarily in the third quarter and had a very strong third quarter as we got that production through and met our customer's demand. Martin H. Richenhagen We do not have capacity restrictions. Andrew Obin Merrill Lynch But It's relatively flat given your production forecasts? We produced in Brazil, but sell into the other South American markets. Some of that will be offset a little on the engineering and other investments that we talked about. So that would be the main things other than that we did have some issues with supplier delays and inefficiencies, but I would not say that those were very significant, but it did cost us some minor amounts. And then the follow-up question on capital allocation with the leverage in the balance sheet now so low and your outlook for free cash flow pretty robust next year what do you think about disposition of that free cash flow with regard to the possibility of dividend or share repurchase? The mix can change a little, we are obviously looking at when we do these forecast how we're going to and what our production is for those products what our demand is and rolling those out, but you can have differences in mix between quarters that can impact that kind of analysis you're doing. Martin H. Richenhagen Well actually we faced some problems with various suppliers all over the world so to say I think first of all we could fix some of those problems we also identified some other sources in order to be less depending from some suppliers that didn't perform that well, and therefore I think we'll be in a position to fix it during the year certainly at the beginning of the year it's a little bit difficult because you still have some overlap from last year, but I'm optimistic overall. Andrew Obin Merrill Lynch And going forward, you noted that you were lagging pricing when you are exporting stuff out of Brazil, I assume is primarily to Argentina right? There are products being now introduced in those markets that are not Brazilian source and so it's probably a little more difficult, but overtime we expect to be over to get that those margins back up and get the prices back up. And then I'm wondering on your discussions around supply chain stress if you can characterize for us what you think that level of stress would be in 08 versus 07 is it the same is it alleviating, could it get worse, take us through your views on that? And then in the first half of 08 should we expect over production versus retail for the North American market given what seems to be significant demand increases there? But, think back in first quarter 2007 we talked about the Fendt business ramping up productions slowly of its 900 series new product introduction, and we also had some issues with our engine supplier in the first quarter. Martin H. Richenhagen Strategically we just implemented a built to order logistical approach to our business, so that means we normally want to under produce or to say compare or let say to reduce our inventories further. Joel Tiss Lehman Brothers Maybe... Andrew H. Beck New products it's across the board, we've got some of the longer term new products or some new products that we don't even have now right now sugarcane, harvester, forge harvester in Europe where R&D expense is for some high horsepower tractors that will be introducing at our Bouvet facility this year that we are very excited about. Andrew H. Beck I think as we said in December we are making lots of improvements in our North American operation, but they constantly get pushback, back down by the impact of currency. So if we did get a stimulus plans and we've saw a demand pick up in the U.S. as we did in 2004 when accelerated depreciation was expiring last time, you will be able to take up your production schedules? The $50 million of additional R&D and system project investments, as well as the distribution expenses that we have, but we are certainly anticipating that our operating margins will be improved in 2008 over 2007. Given all the new products given everyone's plant capacity loads were higher why we would not see more price in 08 than 07? Andrew H. Beck Well we are hoping that our operating margins in South America will be relatively flat 08, versus 07, so the impact of currency we are going to offset with improved productivity and other costs performance. So your outlook is not constrained by your capacity? Andrew H. Beck Well for on a seasonal basis we always over produce retail in the first half."

Specific levels were as follows, approximately five months for tractors, three months for combines and seven months for hay equipment. Slide nine addresses AGCO's free cash flow which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. The weakest segment continued to be tractor's under 40 horsepower that are more closely tied to residential construction and general economic conditions. We also work for our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improve gross margins this year. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the range of $275 to $325 million and free cash flow in the $150 to $200 million range, after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures. For 2009, we expect continued weakness in tractors under 100 horsepower and moderating demand for high horsepower tractors. The production delays also caused us to miss sales in Australia and New Zealand which were highlighted earlier on our regional sales slide. In the fourth quarter of 2008, AGCO's pricing actions offset material cost increases. After record 2008, we expect 2009 South American industry volumes to be down significantly due to the high weather conditions and the impact of the tightened credit environment on planted acreage and crop production. We continue to believe AGCO is well positioned financially, strategically and operationally to serve our customers and execute on the positive long-term fundamentals of the agricultural sector. As global systems improvement initiative for our products business was completed in 2008 and is expected to produce inventory savings. While our 2009 results are very important to us, we're also focused on AGCO's long-term profitability and we will invest an increased engineering in capital expenditure this year. While AGCO's total unit tractor sales were lower in the full year of 2008, AGCO's unit sales of tractors over 100 horsepower and combines both showed strong growth during the full year of 2008 compared to 2007. Slide 4 illustrates our production schedules for 2007 and 2008. Our new reduced production schedules are aimed at working -- lowering our working capital during 2009. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. I want to stress that with the global recession tightened credit markets and volatile commodity prices there is considerable uncertainty around the market conditions, we will face this year. We are reducing our 2009 production schedules to drive down our inventory levels as well as in response to the softer demand forecasted for 2009. And finally our distribution strategies are expected to improve inventory turnover and working capital utilization as we progress with rationalization of dealers in North America. Slide 5, details industry retail farm equipment volumes by region for the full year of 2008. At the end of 2008, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12 months basis was improved for combines, level for tractors and up for hay equipment compared to 2007 year-end levels. Supplier delays, limited credit in Eastern European markets and softening demand because our inventory levels to exceed our forecast. For the full year of 2008, our production of tractors and combines was up approximately 18% from 2007 levels. The graph on the slide shows the free cash flow during the full-year of 2008 compared to 2007. Our strict focus on agriculture equipment has kept us less exposed to the ailing general economy. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements including some related to future sales, earnings, production levels, market share improvements, availability of financing, general economic conditions, currency translations, foreign income, working capital, cash flow, margins, effective tax rate, interest expense, market conditions, retail sales financing, pricing levels, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives. The industry also experienced declines in the 40 to 100 horsepower category. Throughout 2008, we explained how the free cash flow would be down from 2007 levels due to increased capital expenditures for additional investments in our plants and new products, as well as increased working capital to support our 20% plus growth in sales. The absorption benefits from higher volumes were partially offset by raw material cost inflation which hit us hardest in this region. Our plant rearrangements and factory process improvement initiatives are also expected to generate savings as we move more of our production to pre-sales and build to order. We did continue to see some supply across constraints in the fourth quarter primarily for tires and wheels. Tractor and combine production levels were up 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. In 2009, we are very focused on working down our inventory levels by adjusting our production schedules, particularly in the first half of the year. Industry retail sales were up approximately 24% in the over 100 horsepower tractor segment and the combine market grew approximately 22% in the full year of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Our supplier constraints were principally tire shortages which delayed production in Europe and resulted in heavier working process inventory. Volume growth from the market strength and new product introductions, distribution improvements, the positive pricing environment and expense savings initiatives all contributed to the improvement. We've maintained a high level of financial discipline and it's reflected on our balance sheet with our low level of net debt. We expect lower volumes and production, increased engineering expense, higher interest expense and a weak product mix will keep our first quarter earnings per share in a range of $0.15 to $0.20. We are projecting 2009 sales to range from $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion. Slide eight reflects the progress we have made in reducing our investments and inventories and receivables. Our 2008, year-end inventory levels were higher than we had planned. We were impacted by a number of issues including supplier constraints, limited credit in Eastern Europe and Russia, and also by softening demand. As a result, our year-end inventory finished higher than planned and contributed to the decline in our free cash flow.","Joel Tiss Buckingham Research I wonder, does the exchange rate changes have any impact on sort of the intensity to move production out of Europe and Brazil into the U.S. or that's sort of a long-term project that there is no impact? Martin talked about some very important new products that we introduced here in North America on high horsepower tractors, we've got new products in Voltras (ph) coming out later this year, as well as new things coming up with that. Some of that should probably be able to get sold in 2009 and other parts of inventory will work at diverting to other markets as well. So I think therefore overall we can be highly optimistic that some income will be pretty strong also in the future. But, overall, I'm very optimistic and overall I'm also... Martin Richenhagen And for tractors, it might be interesting for all of you to know that last week we did do a major product introduction for high horsepower tractors under the Massey Ferguson, Challenger AGCO brand, here in Atlanta, we had rented the draw down (ph) and we have more than 2000 people attending the meeting. We have a major capital expenditure project where we are expanding some of the operations particularly UN transmission building, as well as looking at some advancements in the assembly area as well, which will give us more capacity but is well, really relates out the entire flow of the operation and gives us significant productivity benefits going forward. One, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that South America was a region where you were sort of hit by material cost more in the quarter. The real key to the increase from 2008 is the projects that we have going in advance. As you look in Brazil, again, there we do have a credit operation there, our credit standards will be the same and... but I would obviously expect the number of applicants to go down just because we think the markets down. Jamie Cook Credit Suisse Just South America, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks the material cost there and then what you're assumption for the full company for the full year? Mark Koznarek Cleveland Research Company Okay, and then the high horsepower tractor category in North America, I think in December we were talking that, that category was going to be up despite the overall market down 0 to 5, is that still your expectation? Andrew Beck I think, we had look at our orders that we have right now on, North America they are up from where we were year ago, particularly strong on the high horsepower side of the market but still are concerned about situations on the lower end horsepower into the market, that's really more tied to general economic conditions and that's what's primarily driving down the market in our view. Joel Tiss Buckingham Research Second, CNH is saying that they think supply demand of corn and soybeans and wheat is going to come into balance in 2009 and you seem to be saying that probably not, we're still in a strong market for the foreseeable future. Ann Duignan JP Morgan My question is based on slide nine, where you said that your free cash flow was impacted by customer credit. And then my last, in terms of material costs for the entire company relative to pricing and then my last question, I know you've talked about production being down, it being down more in the first half versus the second half. Is that just a mix change and you're not shipping as much large product to somewhere like Eastern Europe or is pricing coming under pressure right there in the marketplace with the moderating demand? Andrew Beck What happened was we had produced tractors that were just in for certain markets, particularly, Eastern Europe and Central Europe that we did not ship because of lack of credit availability in those markets. Martin Richenhagen That's more like a long-term project. And Andy, how much of a working capital cut does your free cash flow guidance assumed for the year, and can you help us through what kind of cost savings you expect or working capital savings you expect from the initiatives you outlined early in the call? So that is probably... that is most of the... almost all of the increase from 2008 would be associated with that project. And then the under production versus retail to control the inventory or get it down. Martin Richenhagen Just look into the wheat production, wheat and then you can see that there still will be a problem and I look at it more long-term, and what I see is that fundamentals didn't change. Andrew Beck Yeah, we just... didn't get some product there that some of the higher horsepower equipment because of some of our supplier delays and so we just had kind a weak mix and some currency issues affecting us in the fourth quarter. Martin Richenhagen No, but you know that we did put three light assembly factories into North America. Lastly, just a question on the backlog, as you see kind of weakness in international areas, as an example you talked about the Eastern European Russian drag on some of the European production rates. Andrew Owen Bank of America And if you look at your order book for high horsepower equipment and compared to where you were last year, are you seeing any specific red flags to be more cautious on, particularly large horse power equipment in the second half albeit now it include combines there too? And when you look at the crop crisis as it come... the commodity prices, those are what you could call crisis prices and compare them with other commodities and then you will see that they didn't go down as much as prices for copper for example or things. I think what we're targeting is that we will reduce our receivables and inventory by over... by 200 million plus but some of that will get offset by probably lower accounts payable and accruals because of the volumes coming down as well and production volumes coming down. And we had about 2000 people... more than 2000 people attending the meeting, and we are very proud to be in a position to tell you that the leading tractor technology in high horsepower with us and everybody confirm that. So that means this seems to somewhat underlying the assumption that the demand for food and also the driving factor of changing diets and renewable fuels will be very important, and the fundamental didn't change at all. Jamie Cook Credit Suisse What do you assume for material cost for the full company for the year? Are we ever going to get back to the held seen days of '05, '06, when I guess they were up in the mid- teen area or there is things that have change this or maybe in the Gary Collar area of 10%, 11% is optimum due to more competitors, maybe more integration, bigger staff etcetera-etcetera down there. So that means we are heading into that direction but we of course, want to do that in a very careful way and not add just overhead cost to the organization. As well as the impact of tightening credit and credit availability is not really on the tractor credit availability because we have AGCO Finance, but it's more credit within the entire sector and so we see grain production to be down in 2009 and that will impact as well as the drought and in other situations we think will impact the market fairly significantly in 2009. Andrew Beck We don't have any thoughts of participating in the financing of the equipment in those markets at this point. So we're getting a lot of throughput now through that Caterpillar network and with very good results. Is there some of the drought or the financing problems that are going to keep production down or just give us a sense of what you're seeing out there? I don't expect the cost to continue to go up at the same rate, but we are not seeing the prices of steel and other materials go down as rapidly as we are and some of the other markets at this point just because of exchange rates and local market conditions but we're starting to... hopefully we'll see some change throughout the year but certainly not as much as we're seeing in other markets. So which means or underlined in a way that they need equipment urgently and that might also have some impact on the politicians to put some maybe finance, quicker finance subsidies in place. I think when you look at the lower production that's going to impact our margins by about $10 million to $12 million in the first quarter. Or was it just shipments not going out? Jerry Revich Goldman Sachs Can you please help us through the drivers of the difference between your outlook for retail sales versus company sales, particularly in light of the production cuts you mentioned; sounds like you expect retail demand to be down 10% or more but your sales guidance from prior sales could be orders only down 5 or so percent. So we were effectively holding inventories into the year that we had previously had demand for but chose not to ship or couldn't because of credit issues. Henry Kirn UBS Wonder you discussed a little the age of the fleet versus historical by region and how you view replacement demand going forward? So that means we are very optimistic that we also here in North America start to become a much more competitive and we do that by our technology because we do	as you know we never were very much in favor of buying market share by price. It's more related to low cost production which is... which grain production is going to be down next year and as well because there are more costly machines than little more effective by credit conditions as well. Andrew Beck Our production will be down based on our current outlook about 8% to 10% for 2009."

As Martin mentioned, we will idle plants in the first quarter of 2010 to address these opportunities. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. The decline in operating margins resulted from weaker sales, lower gross margins and higher engineering expenses, as a percentage of net sales. Softer market demand produced lower sales and the shift in mix of products towards smaller, lower margin tractors also contributed to the decline. Current estimates show that global grain consumption increased in 2009, demonstrating the power of these trends. We are projecting softness in the Western European markets through the first half of 2010. We're projecting 2010 sales to range from $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion or roughly flat with 2009. Despite the softening demand throughout the year, we were able to reduce inventory and accounts receivable at year end by over $550 million on a constant-currency basis from 2008 year end levels. Lower production volumes in North America and Europe were partially offset by margin improvements in South America. Our dealer month supply in North America was as follows: Tractors were at 4.5 months, combines at 2.5 months, hey equipment at 6.5 months. However, we will make further production cuts in early 2010 in response to the weak demand in some of our markets. We are optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for industry in our business. At the end of December 2009, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was lower in all categories at the same time a year ago. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow in the $75 million to $100 million range during 2010. AGCO's results in North America benefited from improved margins from new products, productivity initiatives and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher engineering costs and the impact of lower production. The significant production cuts made during 2009 resulted in lower accounts payables which limited the benefit for the full year in working capital and cash flow. We are idling some of our plants during the first quarter to further reduce inventory levels. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. We believe favorable farm economics will continue, providing farmers with an incentive to invest in farm equipment, that makes them more productive and more efficient. The sales of high horsepower tractors and combines into the professional producer sector weakened in the fourth quarter, as the late harvest added to farmer conservatism. Destocking initiatives and softer end market demand in the dairy and cattle producer segments contributed to the decline. In the fourth quarter of 2009, operating income declined in North America due to the significant drop in sales, production cuts and dealer destocking. We will make forward-looking statements, including some related to projections of earnings per share, sales, population growth, market demand and conditions, product offerings, margin and productivity improvement, plant idling, inventory management, working capital, free cash flow, exchange rates, production volumes, general economic conditions, pricing increases, farm incomes, grain consumption, capital expenditures, pension and benefit claim, costs and engineering and restructuring expense. Hay tool, high horsepower tractors and sprayers showed the most weakness. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in both China and Russia. Our disciplined inventory reduction program cut company and dealer inventories by more than $550 million on a constant-currency basis compared to December 2008 levels. Our production volumes for 2008 and 2009 are illustrated on Slide 4. We will make deeper cuts in Europe and North America and increase production, at the same time, in South America. With a net debt position near zero at year end 2009, we planned to continue investing for future growth in a form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. Weaker sales, lower production volumes and increased engineering expenses focused on our high-horsepower tractors and new harvesting products contributed to the margin compression. In South America, the order book [ph] is up considerably from year end 2008 levels. Our first quarter 2010 production of tractors and combines is expected to be down approximately 20% from 2009 levels. For the full year of 2010, we are expecting tractor and combine production to be down 3% to 5%. These earnings per share projections, exclude restructuring expenses expected to be incurred in the company's European operations, estimated at approximately $0.10 per share for the full year of 2010. In the seasonally low first quarter 2010, tightened dealer inventory in North America and Europe is expected to drive lower production and sales levels and result in an adjusted net loss of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. A Brazilian government financing plant for small farms and low interest rate program launched in July, covering all equipment, helped to stabilize the Brazilian market. We've slowed the investment in some of our plant productivity projects and new products during the year in response to softening market conditions. In 2010, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4's emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 20% or $40 million. We also look for our productivity in purchasing initiatives to drive improved margins. We made good progress in lagging inventory levels in the fourth quarter of 2009. The most significant declines occurred in the sub-100 horsepower tractor segment, which are closely tied to the weak residential construction, dairy and livestock production areas. In the fourth quarter of 2009, operating income declined due to lower sales, production cuts and inventory-reduction initiatives. We still have work to do, especially in the area of hay equipment. We expect gross margins improvement to be offset by higher engineering and pension costs. Countries have backlog in Europe and North America is approximately half the level of the end of 2008. We're also planning a lower use of seasoned working capital during 2010, by reducing the build of dealer and company inventory required for the spring season. Softening global demand is evidenced in our order books, which have declined significantly from year end 2008 levels. Slide 8 details our progress with inventory reduction initiatives. The low interest financing program offered by the Brazilian government in July produced strong growth in AGCO's fourth quarter sales in Brazil compared to 2008. The volatility in commodity prices and the expectation of lower farm income contributed to a higher level of conservatism in farmer's equipment purchase decisions. The benefit of our working capital reduction initiatives can be seen on the slide, AGCO's the fourth quarter cash flow of $448 million we generated largely from working capital reduction. This change generated approximately $41 million of cash flow, which is included in our free cash flow analysis on Slide 9. Stronger market demand, a richer product mix and improved factory absorption had produced the increase.","Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes, hay equipment was down about 25% in North America. So the level of dealer used inventory that we're seeing, that's in America, we're seeing I would say is not way out of line. I do believe that there's an element of growth that we need in order to get to that mid-single-digit operating margin that we've discussed. Or is there a potential given your market outlook for continued production cuts relative to retail in Q2? So it's a mixed bag of how we're achieving that, but overall production down 20%. But overall, as Andy says, it's a result of becoming more efficient since we also work on a major core process re-engineering and redesign project for the Beauvais factory, which includes also our transmission joint venture we have basically in the same building. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO I would categorize our order situation as stable now, stabilizing. Andrew Millard Casey Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Follow-up question on the backlog, Martin, I believe you, in your comments, talked about it being roughly 50% down year-over-year. In Europe, I think I don't have a number for you, but I would expect that dealer inventories are up probably in the same percentage as North America. Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Can you give us some color on what you're seeing with the used equipment inventories at your dealers, maybe some color by region and by type of equipment. Meredith Taylor Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division Again, I was trying to get a better sense in how you're looking from production to move sequentially relative to the fourth quarter. We have a full supply here in 2010, so I think I don't have any specific numbers to give you on that, other than, we project that our sales will improve there in that sector in 2010, so I think it's more how we performing in 2010, that's a real factor. I'm just trying to get a sense, order of magnitude of how much more it would have been for some of the hay equipment. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Versus the third quarter, well, sequentially, the production was fairly level with the third quarter. And did we get any material cost benefit in the fourth quarter specifically? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Jamie, I'm a little bit more optimistic even because we just launched a major project in the area of purchasing and materials, and I expect that this will help us also. Meredith Taylor Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division As we rolled forward production levels for the first quarter, again, if you can just talk sequentially around the trends that you're looking for from a production level. So moving forward, as we look at our European facilities, as Martin talked about, we have a number of projects that were kicking off in 2010 that we hope will make significant improvements in the productivity of those facilities. We certainly were idle like in our German facility for the month of January. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, in the first quarter, we expect production to be down about 20% from the year before. The majority of those costs relate to: One, the closure of our Randers, Denmark facility, which was a small combine assembly operation that we had. And then what we have, the industry and our company has been able to respond to that with pricing changes if need be if it's a material difference. In terms of used inventories, our used dealer inventory is up somewhere between 10% to 20%. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Some of the small that European players even don't make money with that type of activities. I mean, can you kind of walk through, more broadly, the production cuts that you saw in some of those other categories? Robert Cameron Wertheimer Morgan Stanley, Research Division Do you have a sense of the sentiment among the end users of the larger equipment? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, in Brazil, one of the key customers of the large equipment is the sugarcane area. In South America, orders are higher than they were a year ago. Andrew Millard Casey Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division I have a follow-up to Meredith's question on the inventory, with the production cuts in Q1, do you expect your inventories to be basically where you want them to be? And also, I think we saw in 2009 some discounting as companies were reducing their inventory levels. Certainly, you see what's going to happen in 2010, our engineering costs are going to be up 20% and a lot of that is related to being ready for the Tier 4 interim. But we don't really expect engineering costs to come back down in 2011 and that relates to some of the projects have in place but also getting ready for 2014 the Tier 4 final. And that is a high-horsepower market, particularly for our Vulture products that have a good share of that business. And so as we move up that chain and try to move our market share up, I think there's going to be a significant leverage that we can create. For material costs, our assumption, you're right was that it would be relatively flat. We have seen some changes in what's happening out there with material costs here in the last 30, 45 days. So as we come in to 2010, we are in a way carrying over some benefits from lower material costs as we enter into 2010. We are seeing some margin improvement, and so that should help us, we expect, but we will have higher engineering expense in North America as well. Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division So just coming back to the North American inventory, can you give the used inventories. And so that's how we're getting to the 10% projection. And what's glide path over, say, the next three to five years of how that gets addressed? As we said, production will be down about 20%. Second quarter might be projecting to be a little better, but it's based more on comparables than I think a change in market condition. I'm talking about German and Italian manufacturers. But as you look at production, it should be down. So there is still too much inventory out there in the industry and with our dealers with hay equipment. As we've said in our comments, we're seeing an increasing demand here projected in South America in the first quarter but significantly lower sales and production in North America and Europe, as that's the demand profile, as well as we're continuing to try to cut production in order to reduce inventories and/or reduce the level of seasonal build up inventories that we typically have in the spring selling season. And then the other significant cost that we're incurring is a permanent headcount reduction in some of the workforce in our French facilities, both in our transmission joint venture, as well as in the assembly operations in Beauvais. And so we think there's some risk of higher material costs, particularly in steel and as we go throughout the year, but it still a little uncertain. And we'll continue to cut production in that category throughout the first part of 2010 as well, relative to what we'd normally do. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO I don't have anything specific on that but certainly, when you look at North America, the production that we have is in, most of the production cuts is in hay equipment. We gave you the month supply of dealer receivable, dealer inventory on hay and it was still higher than where we'd like to see that. In terms of our... Jamie Lyn Cook Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division The material cost, when did you... Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes, material costs, sorry, lost my train of thought here. Meredith Taylor Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division You offered some views on year-over-year changes in production levels that you've seen, but can you talk a little bit about the sequential changes that you saw in the fourth quarter? So what we'll see there is, overall, the production was down about 20% or so in the fourth quarter. That production is moving to our joint venture that we have in Italy called Laverda. And the fourth quarter was down approximately close to 20% in Western Europe, I think we project that it'll be down about that much, at least in the first quarter of the year, maybe even the first half. Is that across the board or is that skewed towards small equipment versus large equipment? Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division I just want to talk about your Western European outlook, you've maintained to that 10% versus 2009. It's more on the material cost side and the productivity that we can achieve in those plants that will hopefully drive margin improvement in the future. So those will be ongoing as well as we work through those negotiations in that process. We're working very hard on how to integrate those facilities, particularly on a material buy standpoint to being more productive and the way that we design products and the way that we buy our materials. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, I think what you're saying in the terms of the margins going down was a significant cut in production here in the fourth quarter as we are working our inventory levels down and you see the results of what we achieved there. But looking at our demand profile and our prospects for improving productivity in that plant, we did not feel like we needed those permanent workers anymore. They have probably a little more of an issue and that they rely on the Eastern European market as a source of moving used equipment. And so we do have issues with used inventories, and that's making dealers be a little bit more conservative in their buying patterns, so that is impacting the market at this point. And that's unusual and that we usually have shutdown periods in the third quarter, so our production is typically the lowest in the third. And that production is all in really is more significant cuts than that in Europe and North America with higher production expected in South America. Robert Cameron Wertheimer Morgan Stanley, Research Division In Brazil, I just wanted to ask about the mix and whether you can differentiate the trends you're seeing between buyers of smaller equipment and buyers of larger equipment? I don't have the specifics by market, but certainly, the majority of the cuts were in, all the cuts were in Europe and in North America, the [ph] South America production would've been up. Meredith Taylor Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division You talked about production levels for tractors [ph] and combines, but I realize that while the inventory reduction efforts that are underway at this point, which is in North America, it's around hay tools, balers and some other categories. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, we've talked a lot about what we're doing in North America, and you can see that we're making some improvements in the margins through a lot of our productivity projects that we have in place. But I think that we can afford with that projection that the market could be down a little in the first half relative to what we saw in the second half of 2009. And hopefully, most of the inventory levels are now in line in the industry or getting back in line, and so there won't be as much of a factor in 2010. There's probably been a shift of about 15% to 20% in the mix of sales between low and high-horsepower tractors in 2009 compared to 2008. And then my other question, I think at your Analyst Day, you did say you were anticipating material costs to be flat for the year."

We will make forward-looking statements, including some related to the projections of earnings per share, sales, market demand, pricing benefits, margin and market share improvements, currency impacts, investments in new products market growth, productivity and purchasing initiatives, capital expenditures, effective tax rates, inventory levels, free cash flow, acquisitions and strategic investments, seasonality, industry demand, general economic conditions and engineering expenses. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. Stronger sales and higher levels of production generated 350 basis points of improvement in fourth quarter operating margins compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Higher production volumes in Europe and North America are expected to be offset by lower levels of production in our South American factories. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2009 and 2010 are illustrated on Slide 4. In the fourth quarter and the full year 2010, operating margins improved in North America, both due to higher sales and production. We have introduced profitable new products, reorganized our sales organization, lowered our logistics costs and improved the efficiency of our factories. In 2010, we made investments for future growth in the form of engineering expenses and initiatives for productivity in our plants and new products. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. AGCO's fourth quarter 2010 tractor and combine production was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Margins were improved in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to higher sales and production volumes and a richer mix of products, partially mitigated by increased engineering expenditures. Strengthening demand in Europe doubled AGCO's order board for the EAME markets at the end of December 2010 compared to the very weak level at the end of December 2009. Fourth quarter operating margins in our Europe, Africa, Middle East regions rebounded to 9.5%, up nearly 500 basis points from the third quarter of 2010 and nearly 600 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009. We are projecting 2011 sales to increase 10% to 15% from 2010 levels. Improving order flow along with increased production levels in our North American and European factories were offset by lower production volumes in South America. A weaker geographic mix and lower levels of production and higher expenses contributed to the decline. Our dealer month supply in North America was as follows: tractors, 4.9 months; combines, 2.3 months; and hay equipment, seven months. As a result of strong cash flow for the full year of 2010, our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of December 2010 remains strong. We are optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for our industry and our business, and our strategies are aimed at helping grow AGCO profitably in this environment. AGCO's strong financial position and ability to generate cash will allow us to increase our strategic investments in 2011. Strong crop production in Brazil, an attractive financing program supported by the government, contributed to strong market demand. In 2011, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 10% to 15% or $30 million. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The benefit of increased production volumes and a richer mix of products was partially offset by increased expenditures for engineering and other initiatives. Equipment order boards in North America were also up significantly from December 2009 levels. In addition, we managed working capital very closely as we ended the year, and our strong operating performance translated into over $270 million of free cash flow for the full year of 2010. We deferred the startup of some of our plant productivity projects in response to softer market conditions in Europe. In early 2011, we will close on two previously announced acquisitions, which will bolster our European combine business and provide advanced air-seeding products to our distribution network. In North America, the economics for row crop farmers continued to be outstanding and the market demand for large equipment remains robust. European production was up approximately 25%, and North American production was up approximately 6% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to prior year. In North America, the High Horsepower segment benefited from favorable row crop economies mix and increased 18% compared to the full year of 2009. In 2011, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, improve our factory productivity in Germany and make investments in China and in Russia. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the $250 million to $300 million range and our free cash flow to remain positive in the $100 million range after funding the expected increases in capital expenditures. At the end of December 2010, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12 months basis was lower for combines, flat for tractors and hay equipment compared to the same time a year ago. We also look for new products, improved productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. Improved crop production and increased credit availability contributed to the markets' strength in Argentina. AGCO's company and dealer inventories were at or near targeted levels across all regions. South American production decreased approximately 19% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of softening market demand. In 2011, we expect production volumes to be relatively flat compared to 2010. South American order boards remained strong but were down significantly from very high levels at the end of December 2009.","Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division What is your sense of your capacity utilization in North America? The air seeders' demand and orders are very strong and everything's coming along very smoothly. Andrew Millard Casey Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division If you take the Tier 4 pricing and then if we continue to see input costs inflation through the year, does the Tier 4 price up and the staggered introduction from the competition limit your ability to go out and offset the other cost headwinds? We'll use some of that up in terms of higher engineering and some of these new market expenses that we're talking about. Certainly, if you look at what happened in 2010, we had relatively low sales in the first half of the year because we're still focusing on inventory reduction. Jerry David Revich Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Andy, can you talk about your assumptions for raw material inflation and where that is relative to spot? And I expect that we will increase prices starting in the second quarter to offset our projected further increases in commodities. It was a much stronger quarter from a delivery standpoint than the year before, because the year before, we were working on getting inventories down at that point in time. So no real concern in terms of dealer inventory levels around the world. Again, I think that the thing that could be part of the question is the amount of additional expense and engineering expenses we're expecting to invest in the third and fourth quarter is offsetting some of the sales and margin gains that we still expect to see in the results. Because the North American and European order board commentary is very positive. As their confidence improves and as they see a market growth, they will also invest in dealer inventories from time to time. So these are new models with new productivity that's put in the tractors and combines as well as just putting a new engine in. And so from a mix standpoint and a production standpoint, it was a very solid quarter for us. And margin improvements are a very important focus of the company, so that's what we focus on in all areas, so which means, on one hand, to try to control your costs, to reduce your cost, to redesign your core processes. But I'm also not sure whether the other guys couldn't do something and, finally, might have more capacity than people think. I wonder if there's an opportunity for you to be sort of step up and be the supplier that has a little extra capacity, or correct me if you think I'm wrong about that. We had, I'd say, more normal production schedule or shutdown late in the year in December. Robert Cameron Wertheimer Morgan Stanley, Research Division You quantified the headwind from Tier 4 on engineering expense. One was that production was lower in the fourth quarter in South America. Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division I'm just wondering on the South America commentary, I think you characterize the order board as being significantly lower and the market being softening. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, the dealer inventories do move in a seasonal fashion. But I would think that we're talking at least a 2%, 1% to 2% impact on our pricing in order to meet the commodity price increases that we'll see for the year. So we will have higher engineering, higher SG&A from a year ago that we hope to offset with the higher sales and operating margins that we discussed. And I guess I'm wondering if maybe some of the other players get a little bit closer to being capacity constrained. I can't really see any material sort of share gains in the big equipment. And obviously, with the higher amount of sales in the quarter allowed us to get a lot more leverage on engineering costs and on SG&A, which drove the margin improvement. And also, can you just remind us, does your EPS guidance include the impact of inventory write-up and other acquisition integration charges? The prior year, the demand was so high, and we're somewhat catching up on orders that we did not have much of a shutdown. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Well, actually, we have two completely separate distribution networks and dealer networks in Brazil. Seth Robert Weber RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division And then just lastly, I mean, can you try to handicap where you think dealer inventories may be? European dealer inventories are at or below normal levels at this point, so I think the work's been completed there. And also they don't carry a lot of dealer inventory in Brazil in the first place. So that means we need to make sure that we price for the substantial price increases we see from certain suppliers. So that's the things that we are doing to improve your quality and to actually also be careful with your discounts and try to get the right prices established in the market. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO In general, I would say that we are fine with regard to capacities. Gregory Bradford Williams JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division And speaking of your production outlook and your flat to modestly up outlook for 2011, I mean, you mentioned North America, Europe, higher production; South America, down. I wouldn't project that going forward. What we have in terms of South America orders are down about 30% from where they were. Parts are cheap, but, let's say, the manpower you need to fix those tractors is, of course, expensive. And then South America, the dealer inventories are up but somewhat in line with where the market is. We're in the process of looking at how we do that and how much it is. Obviously, some of the major commodities costs are increasing on us. But keep in mind, the orders were extremely high at this point last year. Our mix was significantly better in terms of selling high horsepower equipment. Mark Edward Koznarek Cleveland Research Company Then with regard to raw materials, what kind of number are we talking about in terms of as things -- as you stand right now, if there's no further change over the course of the year, what kind of raw material inflation are we really looking at, at this point?"

These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. Higher commodity prices and improvement in the dairy and livestock sectors contributed to this increase. We will make forward-looking statements this morning, including those related to projections of earnings per share, sales, market conditions, margin and productivity improvements, commodity prices, farmer income, harvests, weather, market share, industry demand, the impacts of currency translation, new product development and improvements, plant expansion, investments, production volumes and localization, free cash flow, depreciation and amortization and emission requirements, and the impact of the GSI acquisition. As a result, Valtra's first quarter production in Europe will be lower than the first quarter of 2011. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting another solid year of free cash flow for 2012. AGCO's fourth quarter 2011 tractor and combine production grew 8% compared to the same period in 2010. AGCO's year-end order board remained well ahead of last year's levels in our EAME and North American markets. The benefit of increased production volumes, pricing and leverage over operating expenses was partially offset by increased material costs and higher engineering and marketing expenses. We expect production volumes for the full year of 2012 to be approximately 5% up versus 2011. Farmers made record levels of income and commodity prices reached and remained at attractive levels. As a result of the strong free cash flow AGCO has generated over the past few years, our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of 2011 remains strong. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the $325 million to $350 million range and our free cash flow to exceed $200 million after funding the capital expenditures. With the timing of Valtra production, the impact of dry weather in South America, the negative impact of currency and start-up costs in our Chinese operations, we're expecting our first quarter earnings to be about flat to slightly up compared to the first quarter of 2011. With industry demand below peak levels in Western Europe, our EAME region produced record sales on a constant currency basis and improved operating margins by over 400 basis points compared to 2010. We introduced profitable new products, reorganized our sales organization, lowered all logistics costs and improve the efficiency of our factories. From a product perspective, sprayers, high horsepower tractors and combines generated the growth. The improvements we are making in our European factories will impact the timing of production and sales throughout 2012. The production schedule at our Valtra plant in Finland ramps up slowly in the first quarter, following the SAP system cutover on January 1 of this year. We also expect to take more costs out of the business by improving our production and purchasing efficiency and by localizing more of our production. In January, we began assembling high horsepower tractors in Jackson, Minnesota for the North American market. We expect more North American margin improvement by growing our top line through additional new product introductions, improving our existing products and strengthening our distribution. In 2012, we plan to continue investing for growth and profitability improvement in the form of engineering expenses and additional investments in our plants and new products. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2010 and 2011 are illustrated on Slide 4. We also look for new products in our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. We increased the investment in some of our plant productivity projects and new products during the year to support our growth and margin ambitions. We project the GSI acquisition will be accretive to 2012 earnings per share by about $0.45 per share. We also look for improvement in the dairy and livestock sectors, which will help our hay equipment demand in 2012. In addition, our strong operating performance translated into improved cash flow. In the fourth quarter of 2011, operating margins in North America exceeded 7% due to higher sales and production, accelerated new product introductions, along with cost-control initiatives. South American order boards remained strong and are about even with 2010 year-end levels. In 2012, we expect to further increase our capital expenditures as we continue to work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity, complete the expansion at Fendt and establish assembly capabilities in China and in Russia. Our order boards remain strong, and we are projecting 2012 sales to exceed $10 billion, even with the headwinds provided by the weaker euro. AGCO's free cash flow for 2011, up $426 million, included a $127 million benefit associated with transferring our European wholesale receivables from a higher-cost, on-balance sheet securitization facility to our AGCO Finance joint venture. Our SG&A expense will include expenses associated with sites and manufacturing, start-up and market support costs amounting to $20 million for Fendt and $20 million to $25 million for our Chinese operations. Sales growth in Russia, Eastern Europe and Australia produced most of the increase. Sales of high horsepower tractors remained elevated and were up slightly from the strong levels in the full year of 2010. At the end of 2011, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was as follows: tractors were 5.5 months; 3 months for combines; and 7 months for hay equipment. Better harvest in Russia and Eastern Europe in 2011 are expected to produce healthy growth in these markets in 2012. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Higher volumes in our North American and European factories were partially offset by lower production levels in our South American region. Including significant investments in new product development, market development and start-up costs associated with our manufacturing projects, we expect to continue to improve gross and operating margins from 2011 levels. Margins improved nearly 100 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to higher sales and production volumes and cost controls.","Our North America orders are up close to 40%. Just lastly, quickly, I just wanted to kind of get an idea of your expectations for Santal over maybe like a 3- to 5-year time frame in terms of how you would think about expanding capacity or increasing your position in the market. Some of the weaker economies in Europe are not big agricultural equipment markets for us. And GSI luckily doesn't carry a lot of inventory so that was a fairly very minor amount. So I would characterize the material environment as relatively stable. And could you also comment on the flow of machinery eastward in Europe? Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division And would it be your goal to kind of get them into kind of something similar to North America combines, like an early order program, so you can get a sense of what the year is going to look like? So Jamie, if you look at on the Tier 4 expenses for both the U.S. and North America and consider kind of other kind of general material inflation, which we're saying is probably going to be about 2% or 3% next year, we do expect to cover that. European orders are up about 50% and our South America orders are roughly flat. So in other words, if you're shipping a lot out of South America and Europe into the U.S., that would have an impact. But I think there's opportunities there for improvement in efficiency going forward. And I think it's more on the sales side, where we're finding our dealers are very excited about the prospect of selling American-made high horsepower tractors in the market. They don't carry a large backlog. Well, I think you're referring mainly to inventory write-ups that you have to do with acquisition. The Jackson plant expansion to handle high horsepower tractors will help us a little. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO My observation is they made an acquisition of a pretty complex business, which does not generate important profits, or maybe the opposite. Do you look at backlogged bills or book-to-bill? On the engineering side, there's Tier 4 investments, as well as some new products that we're working on. And we certainly think that will help us retain our market share on the tractor side because it allows us to have a full offering of equipment to those sugarcane customers. Joel Gifford Tiss The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated Just on inventories. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Jamie, the GSI export business, this is actually really a synergy because we don't think that we need to add a lot of cost to the existing organization. And they are willing to invest this year, so they're optimistic. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO The deal we normally do is that as soon as you have agreed with the government or have disclosed your plans for investment in local manufacturing in Argentina, they basically allow you more imports. I'm just trying to get a better feel for the current international flow of finished machinery and specifically, how it's affecting the foreign exchange calculations. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Pricing was about 3.5% in the quarter and material inflation was close to 2%. We're seeing good order intakes. And Andy, what was pricing and material inflation in the quarter? But that's not a 2012 event, when we'll be doing anymore assembly activity in Argentina, likely it would be 2013. So anything you can tell us about the current flow of equipment from where it's produced to where it's sold? And so you start to see order -- people putting in their orders earlier and more consistently than you did in the past. Operator The next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs & Co. Jerry David Revich Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Can you update us on the timing of your Argentina local assembly, when that's expected to come online? We will talk about that as soon as the deal is completely done and the company has integrated into our South American activities. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, I don't think -- as we've said, our order boards are still strong. So it's -- the inventory situation is that we worked hard on getting it to where it is and getting all the production out. Their backlog's maybe 1 or 2 months, and that's pretty normal for them. And so we're -- we will continue to see products that we produce in Europe going that direction more and more. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, I think you've seen the ramp-up in engineering expenses that we've had from '10 to '11, '11 to '12. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO As it relates to inventories? And they're not only optimistic about 2012 but also more long-term. Or how are you arriving at the $750 million from 2012? Most of the improvement is going to be volume-related, where we still expect to see some growth, as we pointed out in our comments from -- in the high horsepower sector, as well as in the hay sector. And that's, I guess, what I'm trying to get at, what's the extent of ramp-up that we'll see in your import licenses once you do share the plan? And then I was interested in your comments, maybe this was Martin talking about order books looking very solid. Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division And then since those numbers are bigger than I would've guessed, what gives you the confidence that these markets should be flat, given those types of order books? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes, I think the GSI acquisition actually helps our chances in the future to offer a dividend to our shareholders and that the cash flow that GSI will generate in North America will allow us to have more -- generate more cash in North America, which frees up the availability to return cash to shareholders. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations We're talking a little bit apples and oranges in the sense that the numbers I was throwing out earlier dealt with some Tier 4 costs, which aren't completely material. So it's not necessarily an indication of all about what the market growth will be, but it's also about securing their orders for the next year. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, I think what's happened is that you get in a situation when you're analyzing your orders is that demand has improved significantly here in 2011. There's some engineering and some other costs in there. Is there a large backlog? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Well, when we bought through the implement and drilling equipment makeup, we were in a position to double their volume within a year about. Or is it a little bit elevated because you expect a little more activity in the first half? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, I think the difference there is the level of engineering expenses and marketing expenses that we've been incurring in North America."

These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. After covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting another year of solid free cash flow for 2013. Favorable exchange rates improved further and attractive soft commodity prices have energized the market in South America. For 2013, our SG&A expense will include expenses associated with site and manufacturing start-up and market support cost amounting to about $10 million for our Chinese operations. AGCO's forecast for tractor and combine production volumes for 2012 are illustrated on Slide 4. Lower levels of production in North America and Europe were partially offset by increased activity in our South American factories. Looking ahead to 2013, we expect to further increase our CapEx, as we continue to work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in China. Growth in the key markets of France and Germany was offset by declines in Southern Europe due to dry weather and credit constraints and declines in Scandinavia and Finland due to wet weather and a late harvest. With a healthy balance sheet and improved U.S. cash flow generation capacity, AGCO took the first step in returning cash to shareholders during July when our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase [indiscernible] repurchased $18 million of its common stock during 2012. At the end of December 2012, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was approximately 5 months for tractors, 3 months for combines and 7 months for hay equipment. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the $400 million to $425 million range and free cash flow in the $125 million to $150 million range after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures and higher inventory levels associated with Tier 4 product transition. As a result, our forecast assumes first quarter and second quarter sales will be approximately flat with the same periods in 2012, and we are projecting first quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.85 per share. Core margins were up significantly due to higher sales, a favorable sales mix and cost control initiatives. As a result of the strong free cash flow AGCO had generated over the last few years, our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of 2012 remains strong. We also made significant upgrades to our product offerings and improvements to our manufacturing facilities. In 2012, we reduced our debt by approximately $200 million and going forward, we look to maintain our conservative balance sheet and investment-grade rating as we begin to return cash to shareholders. In Europe/Africa/ Middle East, operating margins were down about 400 basis points for the fourth quarter 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to lower production volumes, a weaker mix of products and the impact of the Fendt factory start-up costs. We increased the investment in some of our plant productivity projects and new products during 2012 to support our growth and margin ambitions. Fourth quarter 2012 production was down about 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. As you know, the Fendt production schedule in Germany was more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year to compensate for lower production during the fourth quarter as we brought the new assembly facility online. AGCO's order boards at the end of December 2012 were approximately flat in North America, down in Europe and up significantly in South America compared to the end of 2011. As expected, these results declined from the fourth quarter of 2011 as we managed the ramp up of production at Fendt, had lower Fendt sales and experienced additional startup costs associated with the new Fendt assembly facility. We expect production volumes for the full year of 2013 to be about flat versus 2012. In most cases, farmers made healthy levels of income and commodity prices remained at attractive levels. Sales growth in Australia and China produced most of the organic increase. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We expect it to continue to improve gross and operating margins from 2012 levels, including significant investments and product development, market development and startup costs associated with our manufacturing projects. We also expect to see improving production efficiency and cost through the first half of 2013. In 2013, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 10% to 15% or about $40 million. We are optimistic that the Chinese farm equipment market remains a significant opportunity for AGCO. In the second half of 2012, we started to feel the impacts of the U.S. drought on our grain storage and protein production businesses in North America. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions, that actual events may differ materially. Favorable exchange impacts, cost-reduction benefits and higher sales volumes produced the increase. The negative impact of Fendt's lower production, especially on German sales, was offset by growth in France and Russia. Gross margins were negatively impacted by costs associated with the start-up and low production at the Fendt facility in the fourth quarter of 2012. In 2013, we expect more normal seasonality for our production and our sales. The strongest growth came from the high horsepower segment due to the healthy income levels of row crop farmers.","We got the inventories lower and I think most of the change was probably around trying to adjust inventory levels more than affecting what we were seeing in the marketplace. And just so to kind of fill up on that, what about some of the extensions and expansions of the tax benefits that we saw on December 31? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO No, not materially. So our price increases were close to 3%, a little under 3% and offsetting the increase in materials, we netted about 1%. Keep in mind that a year ago, we were in the middle of some dry weather down there and actually, the orders were unusually low. And then if I could just follow-up with a question on your cash flow this quarter. So as we get at the end of 2013, we will have additional engine inventory and in some cases, finished goods inventory that allow us to transition our way to having a more orderly new product introductions in 2014. Jerry David Revich Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And lastly, the Fendt production and your P [ph] transition, what was the impact on your EBIT this quarter, Greg? So the first quarter margins will still be lower than what we experienced a year ago for the reasons that Greg discussed with the lower amount of Fendt production and sales, along with a much higher engineering expenses as we're trying to get accelerated on our Tier 4 development here in the first quarter, get a lot of projects through to completion on time. And the order book, where are we compared to last year? That's what we saw -- was in the parts business, the level of -- activity levels in the harvest did cause us to have some softness there. And obviously, that was offset by some of the inefficiencies and lower production that we've discussed already. Just wanted to know, now that we're at the start of 2013, what effect do you think some of the squeezing that's going on in that industry is going to be affecting demand for some of your livestock equipment in GSI? It was pretty good and full-year cash flow came in substantially ahead of what you had previously guided to. So therefore, I think we can be optimistic for 2013. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Alan, if you recall, 2011, we accelerated production at our Fendt facility ahead of opening the new assembly facility, so we had unusually high volumes in Europe and especially at our Fendt plant. Could you comment on what you're seeing in used equipment flow to -- in Europe, out East? Adam Fleck Morningstar Inc., Research Division Following the third quarter, you had thought you'd be increasing production slightly from a year ago this quarter, but it looks like you're actually down a bit. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO It's both, but it's mainly, let's say -- in North America, we really worked hard on a complete reengineering process -- core process redesign. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are looking at increasing inventory in order to bridge our way to the Tier 4 final new product introductions that began in 2014. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes, the order book for South America is about 50% from where we were a year ago. We don't have huge order backlogs typically in South America, but that's a very healthy, good order backlog right now. So just on Fendt, I'm wondering how you're thinking about opportunity for share gains now that you're not capacity constrained? Ashish Ravi Gupta CLSA Americas, LLC, Research Division I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on sort of what's driving the $125 million to $150 million of free cash flow forecast. We did adjust some of our European production, as you see. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Yes, the U.S. equipment market in Europe is still doing rather strong. I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about the order board for South America being up significantly. Philosophically, I'm wondering if you could ever see share repurchase used beyond offsetting dilution as your North American cash flows grow. But really, we saw inventory reduction across all the regions and we're pretty pleased with what we ended up with. Michael Shlisky JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division It's Mike Shlisky filling in for Ann today. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO We don't just -- well, we review that on a regular basis, but the -- we have nothing in the pipeline right now. And for us, it's a great market because we have a very strong distribution network. So as a result, our sales and our margins where, from a seasonality standpoint, unusually high, and that allowed us then to transition into the new facility in the back -- in the fourth quarter, essentially, with that earlier production having been under our belt. I mean, is that going to affect, do you think, livestock players, both chicken and other animals, their appetite for additional equipment? Of course, the product needs some engineering work, quality needs to improve. Also, once you get through your seasons, you're able to get parts inventories down as well. How much of that is driven by high horsepower versus you're seeing broad margin improvement across the product and portfolio in the horsepower range? It looks like you had a significant inventory reduction. We also had our receivables down really just because of the timing and mix of sales from compared to where we were a year ago, may want to get those down a little more than we had thought, and so that drove the improved performance on the cash flow. So it's really a function of the heavy Fendt production in the first quarter last year. We still have some extra heads in the process that we'll work through as we get beyond the first quarter. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO France is the biggest market for farm equipment in Europe. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, the reduction was across the regions, but particularly in Europe, we cut production and worked a lot of work in process down during the last quarter of the year. As we also look at the working capital, we have 2 impacts that I'll point out, one is on inventory. Jerry David Revich Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Andy, can you talk about what was material cost inflation that you saw in the quarter and what are you assuming in your 2013 guidance? And then of course, the high horsepower tractors help, but they're not the main reason. And then secondly, on receivables, since we expect to have a little more back-end loaded sales than we did this year, we're looking for receivables to be higher than where they are this year, at the end of the year."

As I mentioned earlier, Sequent is off to a good start from an economic value standpoint, and we believe that business is well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities throughout the year in addition to realizing in future periods the economic value that has already been generated during the first quarter. Turning to energy investments, we had good results in this segment with operating margins up $2 million due to higher interruptible and firm revenues at Jefferson Island storage facility and higher revenues from AGL Networks… the AGL Networks business due to network expansion projects. We continue to move forward on the Magnolia project and that will help us move additional volumes from Elba Island into the metro Atlanta area. Also, we continue to see strong contributions from our energy investment segment, including better results from the Jefferson Island Storage facility as well as from AGL Networks. This project… it will help with supply diversity for natural gas in Virginia and it also will provide important service for two anchor third-party utilities and will generate solid returns for us. SouthStar's lower results were mainly driven by the increase in commodity prices throughout the first quarter and lower opportunities to optimize storage and transportation assets relative to last year. Moving now onto the prepared remarks, let me just remind you that our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in those forward-looking statements. In SouthStar, this produced some lost opportunity relative to previous years. This year, we reported losses of $11 million on storage hedges and $4 million on transportation hedges. We remain optimistic that we can get the project back on track and we will certainly let you know of any new developments over the next several months. What you see in our reported GAAP results reflects the accounting impacts of the increase in forward NYMEX gas prices and the widening of future locational spreads, as these changes affect the underlying value of our storage and transportation hedges. We expect FERC action on that project any day now. Last year in the first quarter, we had GAAP reported storage hedge losses of $6 million and recorded no significant losses on transportation hedges. Longer-term we have described for you what we think is a very good set of opportunities to develop storage and pipeline infrastructure and we have made significant progress related to these growth projects. This is the first of several key milestones during the construction phase of this $265 million project. I think John covered the basis pretty well on distribution in terms of the largest drivers, which are customer growth and attrition and the continued focus on managing expenses. We also will be breaking ground on the Hampton Roads Crossing project, the HRX project, in Virginia later in the month. The inventory rollout schedule on page 22 of the 10-Q gives you a good view of our expected timing for realization of future economic value of Sequent's portfolio that has not yet been realized in reported results. The project is on schedule and on budget. Given last year's very strong conditions and performance in the first quarter, we had expected lower earnings from SouthStar in the first quarter of this year and had already projected a majority of the lower earnings that we actually experienced when we established guidance for 2008. With respect to the Golden Triangle Storage project in Texas, we will hold the groundbreaking ceremonies next week to begin construction on this important project. As John pointed out, Sequent had a stronger year-over-year commercial activity, stronger by about $5 million. But in reference to the former, we make no adjustments to the inventory that backstops the NYMEX hedges. On a net basis, Sequent is carrying roughly 11 bcf of storage. Although it’s [inaudible] change with changes in forward prices and Sequent's response to capture additional market opportunities, I think it demonstrate the longer-term value generation potential of this business. At SouthStar, John talked about how the cost of gas and rising commodity prices were the major drivers there. In Sequent, it will affect only the reporting of the value of our hedges, but has no impact on our reported inventory valuations. Operating expenses declined $1 million because of lower business development expense and that's because we are capitalizing our cost for the Golden Triangle project after receiving the FERC permit at the end of the year. Drew will walk through those changes in more detail in a minute, but I think it's important to note that Sequent had a strong quarter in terms of generating significant economic value and the majority of that value was not realized in the first quarter but is expected to be realized later in the year. So we reported an additional $9 million in hedge losses as compared to last year, resulting in a reduction in reported operating margin of $4 million year-over- year when combined with the $5 million increase in underlying commercial activity.","Most of what you have seen year-over-year was the difference between the benefits we’ve received in past time periods where we actually had a positive benefit by being able to use inventory to make additional. A question for the outlook for the wholesale segment, given that you had a $5 million increase in commercial activity is that in line with sort of what you're budgeting towards your guidance of $40 million for that segment for EBIT or are you sort running ahead of your plan for that? However, the pipeline will be FERC regulated pipeline and the rate will charge and return we’ll achieve on this will be a FERC regulated return. The project, I believe in service was late 2010... in 2010. The returns on that $45 million investment will be consistent with what are being achieved at the FERC level with FERC regulated pipeline. Single cycle storage [inaudible] tighter, but we have seen a lot of action on deal flow and transportation activities. Now gas prices rise, you utilize storage gas to meet your customer need. John W. Somerhalder II And I would add to that a little bit that one of the difficulties as Drew talked is, you can hedge to some extent but the volumes that actually flow out depend on the weather, which makes it difficult to completely protect yourself. So, we had $7 million benefit from increased volumetric flow, but we had a $7 million offsetting loss from the hedges that we put in place. So it is always a mix and match for a situation, but we are still confident we will come in at least where we are projected. John W. Somerhalder II Again single cycle spreads are important and that driver is a negative indicator, but a lot of value that we achieve are through the high deliverability storage and that depends a lot on the volatility and what happens in the summer with hot weather or hurricane or other activities. I don't think we've seen any change necessarily at this point on the distribution side or on the retail side. The way that we received approval for that project was as part of our Capacity Supply Plan in Georgia, we received approval for that capacity to be part of the capacity that the utility would contract for and that capacity is allocated month-to-month to our marketers for them to use, but then those costs in the Capacity Supply Plan had been approved. On the price side, what happens in a rising price environment is that a greater percentage of the total gas that's being delivered comes out of storage as opposed to just coming from flowing gas. And then can you talk a little bit about the Magnolia project and how exactly you are planning to recover the costs of the, what kind of returns you expecting to see and the timing and things like that? Can you give us a sense for bad debt expenses at the distribution operations as well as SouthStar, kind of what you are seeing relative to your expectations and maybe versus last year? But there are some ways through inventory that you can protect yourself. I guess that's [inaudible] feeling or expectation that we have a change in kind of what our standard process is around recognizing bad debt."

As I said at the analyst meeting, we continue to make very good progress towards completion of our utility and non-utility capital projects, including Golden Triangle Storage in Texas, Hampton Road Crossing in Virginia and the Magnolia project in Georgia. The bottom line is that as we discussed at the analyst meeting, we still are projecting the wholesale services segment to be in the $45 million EBIT range, and that's the same range that we discussed a couple of weeks ago at the analyst meeting. And as John said, two of the main drivers there were gas storage carrying costs and pipeline replacement revenues. These are projects we already had planned to complete over a longer time horizon, but accelerating these investments will help us the state's economy by creating bout 65 new jobs. We will recover the cost of these investments in the near term through our cost recovery rider on customers' monthly bills; and in the longer term, we expect them to be rolled into our rate base as part of our normal rate making process. Sequence has continued to see strong commercial activity, and we feel good about how we started the year and how it positions us for the remainder of the year. These positives were offset by an $8 million lower or cost of market inventory adjustment during the period as gas prices declined relative to our weighted average inventory costs. We will essentially be accelerating about $60 million of infrastructure projects between now and April 01, 2011. Our utility continues to focus on the fundamentals through affected cost reduction and aggressive management of our controllable expenses. We also saw some uplift from the storage carrying charges paid to Atlanta gaslight by the marketers in Georgia particularly as flowing gas prices declined significantly and marketers continue to hold higher levels of inventory in storage during the period. Operating expenses and distribution were down $2 million from last year, and that was largely a function of tighter control and outside services and other costs. With respect to credit and liquidity, we continue to pay down short-term debt during the first quarter, as inventories liquidated and receivables are collected. Also in our utility business, we have very little sensitivity to the downturn in the industrial sector, as only about 5% of our total utility margin has generated from industrial customers across our six utilities. We are still early in the process and mainly responding to data requests, but we will have more detail to share with you on that case a little later in the year. So as a result, our funding requirements to maintain current benefit levels are lower than we had originally anticipated. In just a couple of days after our analyst meeting and that's related to our utility infrastructure enhancement filing, you may recall, along with the other utilities in New Jersey, that we filed a proposal to accelerate to replacement of some pipeline infrastructure in our service area over a two-year period. The various factors that could cause such a material difference are included in our press release and in our 10-Q and are more fully described in our most recent 10-K filing. We also marked our inventory down to market as required by GAAP, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which will show up as lower cost of goods sold in future periods. Before we move to the prepared remarks, let me just remind you that we will be making some forward- looking statements today as part of our presentation and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In Georgia, we had a significant improvement of about $14 million in margin from decreasing commodity prices and higher customer usage. Higher pipeline replacement revenues in Georgia was another significant driver of results for the quarter relative to last year. It is important to realize, however, that because a portion of the first quarter earnings are related to the hedges on our transportation capacity. Gas storage carrying costs were $3 million higher than in the first quarter of last year, and pipeline replacement revenue was up about $2 million. You can see the specific components of operating margin for wholesale on page 30 of the 10-Q. In the distribution segment, operating margin was $4 million better than last year. We'll continue to build inventory on behalf of our utility customers, but we're doing it at prices now that are one-third of what they were last year. First sequence stands out as one of the headlines for the quarter, with significant gains on the storage and transportation hedges relative to the same period last year. In the wholesale services segment, as John pointed out, we had a significant improvement in year-over- year results, and that largely reflects hedge gains on our transportation and storage positions, as 9X gas prices declined and transportation basis spreads narrowed during this period. Underlying these moving parts is a 15% increase in commercial activity year-over-year, very positive out come.","And so we built almost $1 billion worth of inventory last year. Mike Hank And is a good amount of that coming off this year, and have prices on storage gone up just because of the amount of storage that's out there, gas for storage that's out there right now? In many cases as an example the Hampton Roads project, we collect AFUDC on that project. We'll attempt to keep our option open there, but at this point, we don't have plans to move that project forward at this time. I read some commentary about a project called triple diamond that, I guess, was exploratory. So we are very much on track with caverns one and two at Golden Triangle, and we also have the two facilities at Jefferson Island that are functioning well, performing well; and as we just mentioned, we are working hard to get caverns three and four that expansion project back on track. I was just understand at this moment, I was just trying to figure out what contract duration that, if there was basically depending on the length of the contract or how it was booked, if it was something that within a act as more of a physical for delivery even though transportation contract or if just open and does fled with the basis. So we'll have immediate recovery there, and the project we mentioned earlier, as an example, the infrastructure project in New Jersey, there we'll get coverage immediately through the rider, and we'll continue to get that coverage until we roll it into rate-based. One is up in Virginia, Hampton Roads Crossing that’s about 140, a little over $140 million project. It was another Gulf Coast high deliverability salt down storage facility that we have options on and have done initial development work on. The remainder of that project was built to provide services to other utilities, Dominion and Columbia. These two projects, Hampton and magnolia, were you collecting anything in terms of riders or AFUDC or anything like that for those two projects, or has that been kind of a drag on your performance as well that will unwind as you get these things into service? But it's out of our rate base, and so that project will look very much like a state regulated project, even though some of it around comes from our customers; some comes from two other regulated utilities in the state. Doug Schantz We'll see a large cash repatriation from storage and a little bit of that will be used for CapEx. John Somerhalder This is a peak year for us because of the timing on Golden Triangle, with the Hampton Roads project, the Magnolia project, and then the upside of being able to invest in our utility infrastructure, as an example, in New Jersey. We'd just continue to earn at the level that it was set in the order that came out from the BPU until a future case, and the BPU's anticipation would be those costs would be rolled into a future case whenever that happens. Mike Hank So that was another storage project. So we have a portfolio of contracts, but essentially all of that capacity is held on a firm basis. So all of those fundamentals point to a good position for our storage projects. I think both parties want that result, so we can plan our business, and we're in the process now that to get that resolved legally. John Somerhalder Yes, we have a part of that capacity that expires each year, but a relatively small percent. Mike Hank And then, in terms of CapEx for your projects, how much is that for the year? But do you still see pretty good, actually gas prices where they are, it seems like any kind of storage project would be a good one, but you don't see any reduction in the need for this type of project? Andrew Evans A little over $500 million in aggregate, so about a less than a hundred million dollars more than what we actually generate in cash from the businesses . Related to our projects, one we see power generation, a natural gas needed for power generation to be as strong as ever. That project is scheduled to be in service on schedule and on budget by November of this year, that time period, and we plan to have Magnolia pipeline which will bring additional LNG from Elba Island into the Georgia market. So we'll have some capacity expire this coming year. Now we separately have a lease with existing operation of the facilities, and that lease covers the current operation. Not only to take gas out of storage, but put gas into storage when we have cargoes of LNG come in. The Hampton Roads Crossing project, some of that project is associated with providing service for our customers at Virginia natural gas, and that part of the project, little over $100 million will be in the rate base, so it will be regulated. And then on the storage you have running right now, are those longer-term contracts, or do they fluctuate more with the spot market for that? What we have seen on storage values is that we saw prices coming down over the last year. Related to Magnolia, the pipeline in Georgia, that project will be included in our gas supply plan and in our gas supply cost and will recover the dollars there under the gas cost in Georgia, and that is a FERC regulated pipeline. We are in the process now of attempting to settle that with the state and believe that that is also a very good possibility. That is a project the expansion of Jefferson Island, that we are doing everything we need to get back on track. And I believe most of those have been pipeline related projects. it is good project that we have an option to develop. We started to leaching process here about 50 days ago. and we have recently seen a strengthening in the summer-winter spreads the value, the intrinsic values of the storage. We think of these as transportation agreements where we have sublet that transportation in a profitable way, and the value of that transportation has declined since we sold it to that third party, and we're just marking the difference. And just to finish the answer to your question, we also have two pipeline projects that we're moving full speed ahead on. But over the last several months, we've seen that start to firm, but it's too early to say where it will move to, but we've seen some firming, primarily because of the larger summer-winter spreads that we've seen now and the other fundamentals we just talked about related to power generation and LNG expected to enter this market for summer. One of those two ways, we believe, will get that project back on track. So the return will be in the range of a FERC regulated interstate power or interstate pipeline. Also in the time period where we'll see some LNG move into our space, and it looks like it will come in this year, that adds value for high deliverability storage. As one example, the basis out of Iraqi, which part of this transportation is based on the hedges are based on, what we typically see is that basis move, and it gets narrower in the winter. And in this carbon constrained world we see increased pressure on natural gas, especially with new coal plants, time periods on nuclear plants. I assume that's been a little bit of a drag for you all the Jefferson Island, and maybe you could give a little bit of an update on some of the special projects that you have going, like Golden Triangle and Magnolia, because seems like a lot of other companies in your group are getting a lot of credit for future projects that are coming online, and you guys have some interesting things going on as well. Basis tends to expand out in the summer when the loads in the Pacific Northwest and the Rockies go down. That's only about a $50 million project, a little less than $50 million project. And the other thing, just on the reported hedge gains for the hedge transportation capacity, should we think of those as reversing throughout the rest of the year, as there is a need on that transportation, or is that really kind of a just onetime gain that is now realized? And some of the other companies in your sector have had to delay projects just because of the natural gas environment. The project Magnolia, as soon as that's in service, we'll put it in our gas costs. John Somerhalder Almost all of that capacity at Jefferson Island is under longer-term contracts."

Since that time customers have benefited significantly from the stability in our base rates and the improved reliability of our distribution system. In the second and third quarters of this year we will inject the majority of our natural gas storage inventory. Offsetting that decline was the $6 million increase in commercial activity year-over-year as well as the $3 million increase in the gain on storage hedges as NYMEX gas prices declined throughout the first quarter of 2010. We place those projects in to commercial operation in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our controller Brian Sea turned 50 today and chose to spend his birthday with us instead of at home and so we will thank him for that. Our delivered volume was much higher, but we are set up there to mitigate our exposure to weather and we are able to participate in some of the upside of the colder weather during the quarter. We have established a track record of taking aggressive steps during that time to control rising utility expenses and manage our cost well. Obviously we entered the year with substantially more economic value and the storage of rollout schedule than we previously have had and that economic value is embedded in our earnings guidance for this year which we are reaffirming with today’s announcement. However, we continue to see annual increases in pension post- retirement and other labor cost as well as generally higher operating expenses. And that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the statements. All these factors have contributed to higher operating cost and it will be important for us to be able to recover those cost and to invest in programs to improve customer service and efficiency. We anticipate putting the first salt dome storage cavern operation during the third quarter of this year. If gas prices decline we will see the opposite occur only limited by low comp adjustments to the underlying inventory. We have reached about 85% of the first cavern and have now completed close to 60% of the pipeline construction and the compressor station work. And before we move to the prepared remarks, let me just remind you that we will be making some forward looking statements and projections today. The Hampton Roads Crossing project in Virginia and the Magnolia pipeline project in Georgia. Our results also reflect contributions from our completed regulated capital projects. The second milestone is the initial commercial operation of our Golden Triangle Storage project in Texas. The are number of factors that could cause such material difference are those are included in our press released and in our SEC filings. Those results do however include gains on our storage and transportation hedges during the quarter in addition to good commercial activity. The less significant narrowing of transportation basis spreads resulted in the $13 million decline in gains on transportation hedges during the quarter relative to the prior year. Slightly higher pipeline replacement revenues in Georgia also contributed to the margin increase.","So it will be something that we will continue to monitor through the second quarter as we see those receivables edge out both in the retail as well as in the distribution business, but from what we see right now and how we looked at our receivables at the end of the quarter, we felt adequately reserved with respect to those. So in this environment we still have as you know about 4 Bcf of capacity in the first cavern that we are going to go out and contract for. Drew Evans Yeah I think if you look at the rollout schedule for that which basically shows you what inventory is left to rollout for the balance of the year. We will experience a small loss on that transaction, a $2 million dollars relatively immaterial to us and we will lose revenue for the balance of the year, but we have factored that into the reaffirmation behind this. So we feel very good about the scheduling and completion of both caverns at Golden Triangle. Some other companies, I know, in the industry will trade the gas they do have in storage and realize a little bit more than the actual revenue from leasing the storage. If you were to go out into the market today and resell that storage or perhaps maybe spreads you're looking at for 2011, what type of multiple of EBITDA should we be looking at there from a proxy return standpoint? We are largely weather agnostic across our distribution operations business. John Somerhalder I don’t think I will answer the question exactly the way you ask it so help steer me back to what you are looking for, but clearly what we have seen our storage spreads both related to how Sequent goes out and acquires storage capacity and related to recontracting at Jefferson Island. Peter Tumminello Sure I think in combination with what John just mentioned we have also diversified our portfolio for transportation storage and asset management transactions into the west, into the Midwest and I think that geographic diversity has helped us some as well. Just a little semantics on how that works and how that flows through? Gordon Howald East Shore Partners In terms of cushion gas, I know salt domes require much less than aquifers and some of the old gas reservoirs, but is there a way to hedge that gas; and how does that get factored into the cost of the project? Drew Evans Probably not materially different in that number. However as we put gas in the ground as now we are in the refill mode. John Somerhalder Yes, there is a way and as we look at our need for pad gas and as you said it is not as large as amount as you would have in a reservoir storage facility, but as we look at that requirement you can calculate it fairly precisely and we now have certainty quite a bit more certainty about when we are going to put it in. However depending on how this summer shapes with volatility in the market if we see whether that could easily change as we move closer to end service and when the capacity will be made available and we have seen those numbers materially higher when we saw that volatility in the past and we are taking that time to finalize the contracting of that next 4 Bcf. John Somerhalder Golden Triangle, the first cavern, we have leached 85% of the physical space we need to, but that is the physical operation. But as you said we’ve seen some offset with less expense at base gas, pad gas so net result was not a material change in the cost that we anticipate for the facility for the first two caverns. John Somerhalder Yes it is a not large part of the economics, but it is an important part and that is everything from wheeling services related to the header to flexibility that we would have within the facility to provide park and loan and other services and there is an anticipation based on what we have been able to do at our other facility and what other operators have been able to do. Unidentified Analyst Secondarily on the actual storage market as we look for Golden Triangle to come in, and, obviously we have a nice hedge base, but there's a large portion that's unhedged with gas prices and the curve coming down, but, obviously, moving about here. It is a smaller jurisdiction for us and volatility in Florida is what it is, but about $3 million of earnings that we recorded in the distribution segment could be attributable to increase in volume and weather. We have seen some minor increases from miscellaneous equipment and cost. How much of that pickup in volume would you see in earnings, and would any of the firm transportation, firm on the distribution side and firm on the retail. Still we are seeing storage ranges as an example at Jefferson Island that would be close to $0.20 range in that general ballpark. Just wondering what the current take is on the storage market?"

We are continuing to evaluate possible opportunities for the more BCF of GTS cavern one capacity, that is currently not under contract. That business is increasingly flexible and diverse, particularly with a focus on attracting more fee based business opportunities that are not as dependent on market volatility. The leaching process is now at 50% complete, and we remain on track to have it in service by March 2012. OpEx in the distribution segment increased 4%, and that was mainly driven by higher payroll and benefit cost, associated with hiring new customer service employees, as agreed to in the Atlanta Gas Light rate case. Turning briefly to the natural gas market, the fundamentals of the market have not changed materially since our last earnings call. Commercial activity has been solid of $8 million or over 15% versus Q1 last year. With our collection of distribution, retail, wholesale and storage assets, we are well positioned to take advantage of trends that are benefitting the natural gas market; abundant supply, low prices, and clean energy policies signify a long stretch of opportunities ahead. You can see the wholesale operating margin component and detail on the chart at the bottom left of your page. We also have a stronger storage rollout scheduled at the end of the quarter, with $11 million in economic value locked in, compared to $6 million at this point last year. Our focus is on ICC approval, but we already managed several important milestones in the transaction approval process. Turning to slide 11, I’ll start with the Nicor merger process. On the storage front, we continue to make good progress on the second cavern at Golden Triangle Storage. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. While the market for storage continues to be challenged and reservation rates are at historically low levels, I believe the overall value of natural gas storage remains high and we are firmly committed to our long term storage strategy. Retail accounted for 20%, wholesale for 10%, and energy investments for the remainder. Moving to our energy investment segment, which is detailed on slide nine, you can see that Q1 2011 EBIT was $1 million, down from $3 million recorded Q1 2010. We benefitted from strong earnings in the distribution business, which helped to offset these factors, and as a result we are on track to meet our earnings guidance range for the year of $3.10 to $3.20 per share. I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business, on slide six. On the right, note that our distribution business continues to be the largest contributor to EBIT, representing 69% of the total EBIT in Q1 2011. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-Q and 10-K. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Price volatility has the most significant impact on our wholesale storage businesses, wholesale and our storage businesses. We did upsize the transaction to $500 million in order to prefund $200 million, or about 20% of the Nicor acquisition financing, and thereby removing the market risk associated with the long dated portion of our financing requirements. While oil prices globally are sky-rocketing, steady and low natural gas prices are attracting renewed attention from a wide variety of customers. We previously had recorded some level of earnings on the project to AFDUC, so the impact of earnings should be negligible to slightly positive. Since Drew did a thorough job in providing you with the details behind our Q1, I’ll keep it brief today and update you on a few of the major activities we’ve been focused on this year, as well as fundamentals of the natural gas markets. The latest storage figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that gas storage for the week ending April 22 was 11% less than the same time last year, while just slightly lower than the five year average. The dark blue bar and the green bar represent transportation and storage hedge gains and losses, while the lighter blue bar represents commercial activity and the orange bar shows lower cost at market, or low com adjustments, which have been de minimus over the last several quarters. This relative balance shows that while we’ve added significantly more supply in to the system from shale gas producers; demand, largely as a result of the cold winter and continuing very cold spring in the Midwest to Northeast is soaking up this added supply.","It was on that capacity to Sequent to manage on their behalf, and not only are we growing our volumes, but growing types of services into asset management with some of those producers as well. What we provide in addition to those long term benefits for the customers are commitments around distribution ops, headquarters, service levels, employment, those type things. We’ve even entered into several asset management transactions with producers who have taken on capacity of transportation to move that gas to market. From a big picture standpoint at SouthStar, kind of a follow up to Craig’s question, do you believe retail customers are becoming increasingly comfortable switching suppliers, and could the weak economy be causing customers to seek a cost savings option? Peter Tumminello Craig, you know what we’re trying to do in that business, as we’ve talked about, is continue to spend more and more effort on the service and fee based businesses like more and more the producer services and asset management for producers. What we’ve seen lately, with the programs that Mike and his team have put in place is more stable commodity prices, we’ve seen far less of that. And then secondarily on that, have we seen any of that commercial activity continue on here into Q2? We always look at the right time to consider MLP opportunities should we decide to go down that path, and one of the things that we think would be important is to have the right subscription levels on those caverns, and the right terms on those caverns, and clearly with two BCF contracted on GTS cavern one, we would look at contracting more of cavern one and having clear line of sight to contracting cavern two, which will come online early next year, as the best time to consider an MLP. John Somerhalder It even goes one step further, when we manage assets for other parties, in this lower volatility environment, that helps with that when we recontract those asset management positions, it’s helped to some extent, so when Pete talks about the growth trajectory moving forward, we factor in exactly this, that we’re able to acquire transportation storage and some additional arrangements at rates that better match the environment we’re in today than we’ve had in the past. And secondly, we’re just getting into Q2, April is kind of cool this month, and it’s a month of primarily injections, but I can say this; we started out the year with a better storage injection plant, and last year as well, we have three BCF less in the ground at the end of March, but we have a $5 million greater storage rollout schedule. I just wanted to maybe see if I could get a little bit more color on the commercial activity at Sequent. And we are seeing very nice growth in those activities, which are doing a good job of making a business more and more fee and service related. More and more full requirement fuel supply to gas fire power generators, and expansion of our compass business, our commercial industrial business. Drew Evans It’s probably also fair to say Ted; this is Drew, that we would give you almost the same answer for the transportation question as well. It looks like you guys had a very nice buildup of activity, not only for Q1 over Q4, but over Q1 2010. So at this point our goal for the future is to maintain our market share and current level of market. With the costs for the quarter, are we going to see kind of a similar trend throughout the year, or do you think maybe that’s going to tick down a little bit as you get a little further along in the process? We’ve had a lot of gasses gorge, even though we’re down to the more normal levels of storage right now, that’s after extremely cold winter and continuing cold weather, so the market’s very well supplied. We had diversified the portfolio into the Midwest and the West, but it was East Coast cold weather, colder than normal in January February that provided the transportation opportunities primarily for us. Peter Tumminello Ted, we definitely are engaging the market pretty actively now, for one, three, and five year type of terms in our new storage agreements, and we certainly are transacting those new contracts under significantly lower prices, and as our portfolio is rolling off this higher cost, assets are rolling off, we are replacing them with the lower cost. With the delays in contracting out the first cavern there that you just built out, and with perhaps the ongoing weakness in the storage market, would you say that prospects for any potential MLP/IPO sponsorship are at best delayed, at this point? Ted Durbin Goldman Sachs Thanks, talking about natural gas storage prices being down, obviously is bad for Golden Triangle, but it’s probably good for Sequent. Was there some intense weather period where we’re having basis dislocations or was it just more better activity consistently through the quarter? Mark Barnett Morning Star Okay, and one last question, on the producer services, a number of companies, a number of gas utilities have talked about the opportunity they see there, and I’m just wondering how the competitive landscape looks as you’re starting to expand the business in that direction. So that can give you an idea how the storage opportunities have looked so far through the end of March. We are always looking at new products to offer to allow us to maintain share and margin. So we have seen less volatility in the market, lower storage values, so it has shifted out our time line on the ability of the contract remaining cavern one capacity and cavern two capacity. We found a nice group of mid-sized to smaller producers who tend to rely on our services, and as they expand and go into different shale plates, we’re able to extend our relationship with them into those markets. I just think that probably other items will come to fill that gap and we should view this as a pretty reasonable run rate per quarter."

Sequent has historically been active in the transportation market along the east coast, due to various asset management and supply arrangements we have in place with our utilities and with third party customers. The bars show monthly transportation spreads between Henry Hub and Transco Zone 6 in New York, and between and Henry Hub and Texas Eastern’s M3 New York delivery point. This is due in part to the fact that the market needs an outlet for the natural gas over supply. Sequent has been systematically entering into new storage contracts and renewed contracts are being signed at costs that are in many cases 50% of where they were just 1 to 3 years ago. While, we have limited ability to influence the operating margin side of the equation in a single quarter, we did have the ability to control the cost side of the equation. There are also some temporal effects resulting from the warm weather that impact our business that will reverse themselves overtime, some in 2012 and some in 2013. Retail was also impacted by the warm weather, primarily in Georgia where we generate the bulk of our earnings in that segment. Finally, also keep in mind that cargo shipping has historically experienced its strongest results in the fourth quarter. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and in our 10-Q. The largest component of the EBIT decline came from a $21 million reduction in commercial activity versus the first quarter of 2011 due to ongoing low volatility and tight storage and transportation spreads, and John will talk about this further in his remarks. This chart really tells the story of why our Commercial activity has declined year-over-year. As we discussed in March however, we do have legacy higher cost demand charges related to transportation that will be rolling off over the next several years. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. Given that we are seeing these levels at the very beginning of the injection season, even strong natural gas demand from power plants over the summer will have a hard time putting a dent in the storage overhang. And just to remind you, transportation and storage hedge gains or losses and LOCOM are non-cash items, but impact the timing of reported income. The warm weather and oversupply, partly from shale gas in the north-east region, were prime drivers of the year-to-year change. We continue to maintain and build strong working relationships with regulatory commissions and their staff members across our service territories. At the end of the first quarter, the value of our storage rollout schedule was $19 million, which compares favorably to a rollout schedule of $11 million at the same time last year and $3 million at the end of 2011. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Offsetting the lower commercial activity and LOCOM adjustments were storage and transportation hedge gains that were $23 million higher than the prior year. As Drew mentioned our storage roll-out schedule has significantly improved since the end of the year and we are optimistic that we will be able to lock-in additional value as we move ahead in 2012. From an operating segment contribution standpoint, our distribution segment continues to be the largest segment contributor to EBIT, representing approximately 70% of total operating EBIT in the first quarter of 2012. As most of you know, due to the warmer than normal weather and continued robust supply, natural gas prices continued their decline in the first quarter and hovered around the $2 mark. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day in March, our Distribution, Retail and Wholesale operations can’t be affected by weather trends. I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 4. While revenues per unit are down, TEU or 20-foot equivalent unit shipments and market share are up relative to the same period last year, reflecting tropical strong profile in the region and strong management of its business. Had we experienced normal 10-year average weather at our distribution and retail segments, we estimate our diluted EPS would have been higher by approximately $0.11. Most of these effects can be seen in our lower of cost per market for LOCOM inventory adjustments, which are a function of declining natural gas prices during the period. These relationships, built upon consistent track records of efficient execution, have resulted in fair rate case outcomes for the company over the past several years. The seasonal storage spread has widened over the past several months and we expect to realize about half of the benefit of our rollout schedule as we progress through the year, with the remainder expected to be realized in 2013.","But the facts were I think highly supportive to settling this thing out and it is a process that we go through with the Commission, and the Commission is responsible for resolving it ultimately, but we think that the case was made in the hearings and our case all along and the settlement have been, and the stipulation have been very good so far. I think there will be some margin synergies as we had capped some commercial skill up there to go after power plants and things like that little bit down the road as well, but the short-term has been more cost synergies. Predominantly the largest difference between us staff and then where AG and CUB were is on the storage cycling. I’ll just add that Central Valley is a low cycle facility. So the largest piece of that differential, staff didn’t take that position at all and as well we took the position that didn’t have that bearing, so that’s the main difference I think will go -- the ALJ will come out in July with a proposed order, so you can see what the ALJ is going to recommend to the Commission and then you will probably will be September before they actually vote on the proposed order. We’ve seen fundamentals that have helped us with our salt dome storage, just related to the simple cycle spread, we’ve seen fundamentals in California, that are heading in a positive direction, but we do need to see longer-term, a more balanced market to drive the additional value that we should be able to achieve out of the salt dome and I’ll add - I’ll look to Pete to add any additional. But you are correct that the single cycle spread improvement does benefit all storage, even the lower return storage. But because our facilities can be used for that cycle it does add value. It was a relatively small percentage on the revenue side and some, as Pete mentioned, related to bringing in the 2 wholesale businesses together, and some revenue synergies related to what we could do at the retail level with our commodity business and with our warranty businesses as we brought those together. Even though we’ve seen spreads increase, especially that simple cycle spread, we have not really seen the volatility side increase as much, even though in California, good news is we’re seeing some. Even though this is an extreme event where we see so much gas in storage, almost 60% full just after we finish the withdrawal season. And in Illinois, I think, I maybe asked you this before but can you remind me, is there any possibility of maybe looking at a pipeline replacement rider or some sort of an infrastructure program prior to 2014 when you have to stay out? But if you go into next winter and you have something that is similarly warm, there will be a significant premium on storage capacity coming out if we had a second warm winter in a row. Carl Ludwig Kirst BMO Capital Markets U.S. My question is really on the improving storage spreads, and recognizing that the April to January spread is more of a single cycle, seasonal spread versus sort of a high cycle kind of salt dome. But at least at this point, it has not yet translated into rates that are materially different than that $0.08 range that you quote. And then at the distribution segment you also had $57 million for taxes other than income, which kind of seems large. Just on the phone out there you were contracted at $0.08 there for storage. I don’t think there is a structural change to the storage market though based on this event, this year. Is this -- do you see this as just kind of -- because gas got so distressed, just a one-time opportunistic event of 2012 or does this have implications on decisions to maybe develop out the depleted reservoir storage opportunities that Nicor had in the pipeline? The market conditions certainly are challenging around multi- cycle storage, which we’ve talked about. So we do think those are important rate mechanisms that help drive pipeline replacement and help drive safety, so we are very supportive of that. I guess the question was were you -- before you got something like that, were you anticipating much in the way of revenue synergies with the existing albeit smaller wholesale operations at Nicor? John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO I guess the only thing I’d add is that through the hearing process and of course staff defended the stipulation as well as we did. And I think we’ll some benefit, we’re seeing some benefit of Sequent in what we’re capturing is our storage expected rollout value going in to this year and first quarter of next year, being significantly larger than at this point in time last year based on that value. And we feel very strong about the positions that let us arrive at that number. So we see that over time, the more probable scenario is the market more back in balance where we don’t have this storage overhang. But I guess, specific to the project? And then we get back to more normal conditions around storage. I think the hearings validated the basis of the settlement, those have been completed, each party sort of maintained their positions on where they were on it. And we see the rig count materially reduced as we’ve started this year, because of the price environment. And then you mentioned a little bit on the PDR proceeding, I guess I’m trying to get a little bit better sense kind of, is there some more give and take you need to do with the AG and the CUB to get them to sign on, shoot to give the $64 million is a good number, or kind of what’s the -- how do we see this play out through the process? But our Midstream business had entered into those, as well when they sold out that incremental capacity. I think just as we expected, we see a lot of the shared services in concert for all of the business units having just really good reduction in total expense and we’re operating a lot more efficiently like we should. First on, Carl’s first question about widening seasonal storage spreads. However, what we see is we have a large amount of gas in storage, we see a large number of power plants using natural gas, running the coal plants at lower load factors, the gas plants at higher load factors. However, with Central Valley, because we have seen, in California we’ve seen lower hydro availability this year, we’ve seen additional outages on nuclear units there and we’ve seen increased plans for pipeline maintenance. So we think that, that is the appropriate way to move forward and let the process play out at the ICC and I’ll let Hank and Bryan add to that additional color. So it should see a direct correlation on at least the shorter term contracting periods of 1 to 2 year benefit due to the simple cycle spreads improving. Andrew William Evans Former Director And I think it’s fair to say that we would wait on the contracting of our existing capacity before we would contemplate additional capital additions and certainly expansions are far more economic than Greenfield construction."

I would say overall that we've had a very good start to the year from the standpoint of a return to more normal and even slightly favorable weather, as well as efficient control of operating and maintenance expense relative to inflationary pressures. We continue to evaluate these investment and supply opportunities, and we expect to be able to share more details with you in the coming months. As he said, while we did see a year-over-year improvement in reported commercial activity during the first quarter, as we progress through the year, we expect to experience challenges capturing additional value on our storage portfolio since spreads have continued to tighten and compress. Without this difference, our O&M expense would have been down year-over-year, which speaks to our ongoing focus on cost control and achievement of efficiencies across our business. Additionally, we are pursuing opportunities to ensure that low-cost shale gas can effectively make its way into our service territory through investment in interstate pipeline projects. There are several potential opportunities and a number of different configurations for bringing additional supply into these markets. This is an excellent result, and I am especially proud of our management team and employees for all of their work to achieve synergies and efficiencies across our businesses. The increase was largely driven by the withdrawal of storage inventory hedged at the end of 2012 that was included in our storage rollout schedule. Along with the new forecast, we will propose a new 3-year construction program for both our Integrated System Reinforcement Program and for the Integrated Customer Growth Program. As we have mentioned previously, market fundamentals remain challenging for this business segment due to low natural gas price volatility, abundant market supplies and associated low seasonal storage spreads. Excluding pass- through expenses, operating and -- operations and maintenance expense is up $3 million or 2% year- over-year. The infrastructure needs in Georgia remain at the forefront of our strategic planning. You can see here that consolidated EBIT was up 14% year-over-year, driven by a significant improvement in our distribution and retail businesses. Briefly, you can see results for the cargo shipping segment on Slide 8. In Illinois, we mentioned at our Analyst Day in March that legislation is pending with the Illinois house incentive related to process under which we can modify our depreciation rates at Nicor Gas outside of a general rate case. The primary year-over-year driver of $0.15 increase was more normal weather that benefited both our distribution and retail businesses. As you know, we have been evaluating some potential interstate pipeline investment opportunities that would provide expanded gas supply options in growing markets in Georgia and in surrounding states in the Southeast. Cargo shipping also saw an improvement year-over-year, while reported results in our wholesale and midstream segments were lower than last year. Further, and similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2012, the first quarter was impacted by forward price volatility experienced at natural gas delivery points throughout the Northeast corridor, as you can see on Slide 11, this volatility related to natural gas supply constraints in the region and it impacted our forward Northeast transportation positions and caused $4 million in mark-to-market accounting hedge losses. We believe that a significant capital investment in 1 or more of these projects would provide good, stable cash flows and investment returns that are generally in excess of the regulated returns in our utility business. The decline is due largely to higher depreciation, property tax and other storage-related expenses due to the additional facilities in service when compared to the first quarter of last year. The demand for additional pipeline capacity in the Southeast corridor has been driven primarily by recent growth in existing power generation facilities, as well as other planned expansions in the region. We continue to slowly improve market share and utilization with volume that is 10% higher year-over-year. We believe we can replace that pipe over the next 3 to 4 years and have provided an estimated cost of approximately $285 million to complete that work. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. But I think it is very important to recognize that the actions we've taken over the past 2 years related to merger efficiencies and expense control have positioned us to fully capture the margin benefit of more normal weather with essentially no additional O&M expense. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and more fully described in today's 10-Q filing. Our storage rollout schedule is $34 million compared to $19 million at this time last year and $27 million at the end of 2012. First, our reported commercial activity of $50 million was higher than the $24 million of reported commercial activity in the first quarter of 2012. However, these same conditions are economically beneficial to our unhedged transportation positions in the Northeast, which have gained in value in the same time period. Forward-looking statements involve matters that are not historical facts, and our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from our actual results. The company was asked by the commission to make a recommendation to address the oldest vintages of plastic pipe remaining in use on our system, which is about 500 to 700 miles of pipe. These benefits were offset somewhat by increased -- increases in transportation and gas costs and slightly lower retail price spreads. Taking a closer look at each segment, a snapshot of our first quarter EBIT for our distribution business is on Slide 4. Operations and maintenance expense was down 3% year-over-year. Instead, operations and maintenance expense is up just $1 million despite higher accruals for incentive compensation and addition of O&M expense associated with the warranty contracts we acquired in the first quarter of this year. In addition, we benefited from the effects of colder weather on certain of our transportation portfolio positions, particularly in the Northeastern United States. However, the rate per twenty-foot-equivalent unit or TEU has fallen modestly due to ongoing surplus capacity, changes in cargo mix and competition in the region. This improvement in reported commercial activity was offset by storage and transportation hedge losses recorded during the reporting period that we expect to realize in future periods. As a result, when contracts expire, we've either been recontracting at lower rates reflective of the current market or utilizing in-house management capabilities to optimize the assets until conditions improve to support longer-term contracts.","But in general, O&M in distribution is up -- I think it's $2 million year-over-year, including the additional compensation expense we were talking about. I also understand that seasonal spreads are very thin right now on the storage side. So we are realigning the portfolio to tighter market conditions, but clearly, we entered the year budgeting the legacy contracts at a higher storage spread than what we're seeing now. John, maybe I can keep you if you want to give any updates about the whole LNG transport supply efforts? This year, we did not have that same opportunities, so we made the money on the other optimization around those assets, not as much around storage. So with the progress we're seeing, the interest we're seeing and then the industry moving into new products and making those available, we still are very optimistic about our opportunities. So is the -- I guess to some degree, if it's a [indiscernible] cost, it's a [indiscernible] cost, but is the lower overhead giving you the opportunity to execute hedges using the storage at otherwise thinner spreads but still economic? Last year, with the mild weather and the trading opportunities around our pipeline and some storage facilities, it was hard to capture value. So I understand that first quarter gave you some nice opportunities in Sequent, I guess, around the contract, the pipeline capacity. And included this year for the first time was a section on natural gas for transportation. One indication of that was a week or so back, I spent time with LNG 17 there in Houston where it's historically been every 3 years of conference dealing with major global liquefaction projects to export and import. The only things that we backed out here, I think, are items related to writer base -- or I'm sorry, surcharges and taxes, probably the energy efficiency program in Illinois, in particular. So we're off to a very good start, but -- and still an opportunity to make money on storage, but with the current spreads, we see that somewhat challenged as far as our upside on that. But can you talk about any -- with the midstream investments kind of -- with the gas situation in the Southeast, do you have any feeling for the likelihood of -- there are obviously multiple areas where projects might be necessary. So in that time period -- but as Pete mentioned, we still will be able to achieve some value as we de-water and as we cycle that back into gas service. And they made some announcements around growing natural gas use for their fleet in expanding that fuel. We're very active at most of the industry conferences, educating customers around the use of LNG and natural gas form for replacement for liquid fuel. Might there be a situation where you are able to take a minority stake in a project and maybe also take capacity from another project? So the first thing we would look to do in each one of these markets, where we have a market position, is take the capacity that supports our customers and supports the utility and provides the best value for gas for them. We had a material part of our storage portfolio expire at the end of March this year. We experienced some very good values, you mentioned, in the upper Northeast transport and asset management positions, and that was the material contribution to the quarter. Related to storage, we ended the quarter with a rollout value, about $34 million as compared to I believe it was $27 million at the end of the year. Peter I. Tumminello Group President of Commercial Businesses Yes, we're going to be continuing to de-water that facility for the rest of the year, and we'll be just kind of optimizing that de-watering of that facility through the remaining part of this year and into the earlier part of next year. So between realizing planned storage withdrawals for the quarter and then starting the process of reinjecting and optimizing forward storage rollout position, we were able to add about I believe it was $7 million of incremental new storage rollout activity, net of all those impacts. We're not yet sold out on our current capabilities with our current plans. So this year, we actually have an opportunity to fill a like amount of capacity and capture the storage spread. So what we've done is downsized a little bit the size of our storage portfolio, recontracted at lower prices starting April 1 and then upgraded the storage rollout value based on the activity I just described. We rolled good storage positions, but the headwinds are really just the forward spread on the legacy storage contracts. Our deal flow is picking up, interest is picking up. But then at the same time, we're very interested in taking and making an equity investment in those same projects. That's in Alabama, near New Birmingham, and that's ready to go at 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to generate LNG full-time. I think more material though to us in terms of earnings contributions from this will be when we can truly get new facilities or expanded facilities built, more capital invested in this business, with long-term contracts anchoring that capital. This year, Sequent did a very good job in capturing value related to the weather higher demands, some constraints in certain areas on some pipelines. I mean, what we would look to do in many of these regions, and that's everywhere from Florida to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, even up to Virginia and up further potentially over time in Illinois, we see a need at times to add additional capacity that can serve our markets. Here in Georgia, there has been tremendous growth in power generation. Peter I. Tumminello Group President of Commercial Businesses Well, I think the UPS contract will serve a nice anchor for that part of the world of our LNG supply, and we've got several other opportunities around trucking companies that are accelerating their conversion. And I wonder if you could speak to what happened on the contracted storage side at Sequent and those winter months as well? We probably disclosed the announced contract with UPS, which is a 10-year supply contract, with an average volume of about 500,000 gallons per month, mainly in the Tennessee area of their operations. Most of that serve directly off of interstate pipelines. Or do we think at least the full capacity at Trussville could be consumed with the likes of the UPS contract? We have been increasing a little bit of our commercial activity. However, since the storage spread is compressed only $0.30, it's not as great a opportunity as what Pete had originally anticipated. And that's even after taking into account storage hedge losses for the quarter. I'm trying to make sure I'm following all the moving pieces here on the O&M within the distribution segment. However, last year, we captured quite a bit of value as we got to the end of the first quarter by filling up storage at very, very good seasonal spreads and, in that case, $1 or more."

As an example, we purchased the pipe for this project prior to the recent unprecedented run up in steel and pipe prices that we all saw in the industry. The inventory roll out schedule on page 23 of the 10-Q gives you a good view of the expected timing for realization of future economic value in the Sequent portfolio that has not yet been realized in reported results. The first of those items in the gain or losses on... is the gain or losses on storage hedges. We've seen stronger commercial activity for Sequent... for the year Sequent as compared to last year with year-over-year increases of about $8 million. You can see that rising NYMEX prices during the second quarter of 2008 resulted in $48 million of losses on the instruments we used to hedge our inventory and storage. You can see in the table that commercial activity in the second quarter of 2008 was up $3 million relative to the prior-year quarter. That is a lot of reconciliation for the operating margin line but hopefully the breakdown of the components we've provided in our disclosures will give you a better sense of all the moving parts. And SouthStar's exposure is mitigated to a high degree because of the credit quality of its customer base. For example, we're seeing some natural gas conversions by commercial customer as they switch from other higher priced fields. The next three items in the table are the ones that are highly sensitive to changes in NYMEX forward prices for natural gas and changes in transportation basis spreads and these are the items we exclude, when John discussed EPS results earlier. As with most of the other players in the storage development business, we continue to see escalating commodity prices that impact the overall cost of our project. First line you see is what we call commercial activity which is generally the way you can engage economic value created and recognized during a particular reporting period. We are in the process now of finalizing an agreement with Southern Natural Gas that will allow us to move forward under this FERC order and expect to hold [ph] the compression for this project as early as tomorrow. Before we move to the prepared remarks, let me remind you that our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Operating margin increased by $9 million driven mainly by higher operating margins at AGL Networks due to a network expansion project in the Phoenix market. As a result, that project remains on track to be completed and put into service in the fourth quarter of 2009. Consistent with our earlier release, these results include a loss of $0.45 per diluted share for the wholesale services segment associated with the storage and transportation metrics. Most importantly in this environment, we continue to maintain our rigorous focus on cost control to help ensure stable operating results for the year. One thing you should also note is in our earnings release this quarter, we have provided consolidated earnings results excluding the impacts of hedge gains and losses and inventory valuation adjustments in our wholesale services segment. Looking at the second item, which is gains or losses on transportation hedges, the winding of transportation basis spreads during this year's second quarter resulted in Sequent recording of $7 million loss on its transportation hedges whereas last year we saw an narrowing of these spreads that resulted in the $3 million gain to a $10 million swing year-over-year. Turning to energy investments, EBIT for the second quarter of 2008 was $10 million. With respect to the Golden Triangle Storage project in Texas, construction on that project is well under way and we expect to have the brine disposal well drilled for the first half during the third quarter, which will enable us to begin constructing the leech plant and drilling the first cavern. We also had slightly higher margins from [inaudible] storage services at Jefferson Island and operating expenses were up $2 million mainly due to the Phoenix network expansion by AGL Networks and slightly higher cost at our Jefferson Island facility. The factors that could cause such material difference are included in our press release and 10-Q and more fully described in our most recent 10-K filings. The $74 million reduction in quarter-over- quarter earnings from gains and losses associated with storage and transportation hedge positions was partially offset by a $3 million lower cost of -market inventory adjustment we were required to record during the second quarter of last year because of lower natural gas prices. A $2 million decrease in the Atlanta Gas Light relates to the lower customer growth and lower gas storage carrying costs offset by a $2 million of additional pipeline replacement revenues for Atlanta Gas Light. We believe they'll provide more transparency around our business and enable better comparisons between reporting periods, particularly since hedge gains and losses and inventory valuation adjustments in a given period typically are driven by changes in gas prices and transportation basis spreads, and not really reflective of the economic value of the underlying transactions. We will walk you through the quarter and year-to-date comparisons in a minute, but as Steve pointed out, we have provided in our earnings release EPS excluding these hedge gains and losses and lower cost of market inventory adjustments in wholesale services in order to provide a more transparent... in order to provide more transparency into the economics of the transactions at wholesale services and help you better understand our quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year accounting results. The escalation of commodity prices that I discussed earlier has also had some impact on the overall cost of the Hampton Roads Project but we have been able to mitigate these increases on some of the major items. With respect to the Magnolia Project, which will help us to move natural gas from the Elba Island LNG facility into the Atlanta market, about two weeks ago, FERC approved the joint application that we filed with Southern Natural Gas to move forward with this project. As you can see, we had made and continue to make significant progress on these three important growth projects. Given the increases in labor and materials and commodity prices, particularly the cost of steel and higher costs for pad gas, at this point we estimate that the total cost of the project will be approximately 10% to 20% higher than our previous estimate of $265 million. Turning to distribution operations, that segment's EBIT for the second quarter of 2008 was $57 million. We also continue to make very good progress on our Hampton Roads Crossing project in Virginia, which will connect northern and southern portions of the Virginia natural gas system and provide better system reliability and supply diversity. Our retail energy operating segment SouthStar contributed EBIT for the quarter of $5 million equal to last year's contribution.","Unidentified Analyst On the distribution operation, there was the adjustment for the unbilled revenue, that $3 million at Elizabethtown, is that... that's not something that... that's something that's one-time in nature and from prior period, right? There is a little bit more potential for movement of cost on that project than on the other two. How should investors think about the EBIT or earnings power coming out of that, especially the larger projects? As an example, on Magnolia, what we see there, it's a 40... roughly a $45 million project. I mean, how do I think about the economic value-added, let's say the largest mega project, if you or me trying to think about how do you forecast with the incremental EBIT contribution and therefore return on invested capital would likely be? John W. Somerhalder II Michael, it's different for each one of the project I talked about. What we see there is a return very consistent with the FERC regulated pipeline and very stable on that basis. Question for you on your growth projects and the CapEx expected there, how much of the CapEx is actually locked in meaning where you've got firm contract for both materials and E&C labor [ph] for that versus the portion that's not contracted? Andrew W. Evans I think if you look at Golden Triangle, for rounding sake, $300 million project, and we lever that 60-40, pretty consistent with our balance sheet, that would be about $120 million worth of equity. For GTS, that is the one we target mid-teen returns for that type of project. Andrew W. Evans In terms of what we would reports for earnings once it goes into commercial operation, is that what your question is really -- Michael Lapides Goldman Sachs & Co. As an example, for Magnolia, the smallest of the projects, the last project I mentioned, since most of that is pipe that's already in the ground and another important piece is the compressor that we're getting ready to order, and if we... when we finalize the agreement with SNG, we will do that here this week, most of that costs is either locked in now or will be very shortly. With HRX, what we'd say is, a lot of that project, even though some of that pipeline would be used to serve two third-party customers, a lot of that will be used to serve our utility and will be part of our rate base. With HRX, our Hampton Roads Project, because we have purchased the pipe and entered into contracts where almost all of that except for a little construction on land there, most of that is locked in."

However, during the quarter, we were able to build up storage inventory and create economic value that will be recognized later in the year and early next year. Those same trends largely drove the year-to-date results as well in addition to the impact of $6 million lower cost to market inventory adjustment in the first quarter of this year, as a result of declining natural gas prices. The factors that could cause such a material difference are included in our press release and in our 10-Q and are more fully described in our most recent 10-K filing. Now turning to our major capital projects; we continue to make very good progress on both our regulated and our unregulated pipeline and storage projects. We also saw lower commercial activity during the quarter relative to the prior year period as a result of lower market volatility. We have had good improvement in distribution operations for the quarter and year-to-date relative to last year, with a $6 million and $13 million EBIT increase for those periods respectively. You can now see our inventory rollup schedule in the queue, which describes about $14 million of value not yet recognized in this year and some into 2010. As you know we have planned to file the case in November, as required under the rate case order issued by the PSC in 2005. The significant difference there is that we had $55 million in hedge losses that we recorded in last year's second quarter as a result of increases in natural gas prices and the widening of transportation basis spreads. Year-to-date Sequent EBIT of $27 million compares with the loss $64 million for the same period in 2008 and again the differential reflects changes in natural gas prices transportation basis spreads and the relative hedge movements that I just described. These percentages are estimates of our total but are representative of our [fill]. The improvement was largely a function of higher margins at Atlanta Gas Light, from carrying charges we receive for storing natural gas on behalf of marketers and Georgia, and higher revenues resulting from more investment in pipeline replacement and improvement. Now turning to our regulatory strategy; as you know, we filed a request with the Georgia PSC in June for approval of a program that will significantly enhance our pipeline infrastructure, particularly in the outlying areas of Metro Atlanta. The Golden Triangular Storage project in Texas remains on schedule for the first cavern to be placed into initial commercial operation in service in the third or potentially fourth quarter of 2010. In this area we are seeing about a $1.5 million increase relative to an expectation of about $15 million full year, so important for capital to be material for the total. We had higher margins from the management of transportation storage assets during the quarter, but those gains were offset by lower customer count and higher numbers of customers moving to low margin fixed price contracts. This year we have seen a significant improvement in working capital as a result of lower gas prices that are in the $3 to $4 range and taken the opportunity to built significantly more inventory at this point in the summer than last year. Before we move to the prepared remarks, let me just remind you that our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. You may recall last year that we built nearly $1 billion worth of inventory at its peak when natural gas prices were in the $10 to $12 range. Both Hampton Roads Crossing in Virginia, and Magnolia project here in Georgia are on schedule to be completed and in service by the end of this year. I pointed this out in our last earnings call but should probably reiterate the point that we have variable sensitivity to downturn in the industrial sector, as only about 5% of our total utility margin is generated from industrial customers across our six utilities. Overall the earnings improvements in the distribution business is a good result, given the fact that we remain challenged from a customer growth perspective. This year, we saw declining gas prices and narrowing transportation spreads, which resulted in $13 million worth of hedge gains.","We've now seen storage spreads strengthen. However, we did see an opportunity because of very solid storage spreads. So we see some positive trends but because of the lower and tighter storage spreads that it was as little lower than what we saw at the first 2 BCF. So, any inventory built for them would be reflected in short-term balances at corporate, but, we haven’t had any need too, because of declining gas prices. I can't remember how much you actually have contracted out on the first cavern, but we just want to see what market rates were going for in the storage right now? April was mild, June was mild, and so obviously, we feed on weather and volatility around our utilization of transport storage assets. I think you could see as far as commercial activity an ability to capture those types of spreads in the second quarter. Andrew Evans Yes, this is generally consistent with inventory build. So, what we saw was that the negative on the one front was made up for by the positive related to storage and the inventory rollout schedule. What we have seen, especially a year ago, when we saw storage spreads."

And let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those statements. We also made progress on moving forward with the expansion of our Jefferson Island salt-dome storage facility in Louisiana. That’s the Hampton Roads Crossing in Virginia and Magnolia project in Georgia. First and most significantly just as in prior years we can have hedged gains and losses on our storage and transportation hedges at our wholesale services business. With an offset in gain or loss occurring in future periods as the economics are fully realized on the hedge storage or transportation positions. The heads movements this year which are primarily associated with our transportation capacity positions will unwind in future periods as these positions are sold or in the case of storage hedges when the GAAP inventories are withdrawn and sold later this year and early next. Our distribution business has performed very well year-to- date. We also have begun the leasing process on the second cavern which is now about 10% complete and remains on schedule for an end service date in early to mid-2012. Commercial activity at Sequent improved $10 million quarter over quarter but price movements this year produced hedge losses of $8 million versus hedge gains last year of $13 million. We have leased the cavern and are now nearing completion of the nine mile pipeline header system and finalizing work on the compressor station. Turning to our unregulated operations, we have made very good progress on a couple of projects in our pivotal business. The factors that could cause such material difference are included in our earnings release and our Form 10-Q and are further detailed in the latest Form 10-K filings. The increase is principally due to the addition of earnings for pipeline projects we couldn’t service last year. On a year-over-year basis commercial activity is up $21 million while changes in hedge values increased the year-over-year variance by $33 million. As we have discussed before we currently have one-third of the first contract cavern contracted and we plan to begin services on that contract when we begin commercial operations and we will make a decision on contracting the remaining capacity as we get closer to full commercial operations. As you know we filed the Atlanta Gas Light rate case in early May requesting a total of $54 million to recover prudently incurred investments we had made in the business and increases in estimated operated expenses. We expect the permitting process to take somewhere in the range of six to nine months. During the quarter we had hedged losses primarily from our transportation hedges and to a lesser extent our storage hedges. We are continuing to define the engineering project scope of the expansion in order to determine the revised projects schedule and cost estimate. This is because we are building inventory and locking in profits of physical delivery, changes in market prices for natural gas will cause us to support either gains or losses on these hedges despite the fact that there is no change in the underlying economics of the transaction. And we will be able to provide you with more detail around that as we get closer to the beginning of construction. Our storage roll out schedule which is included in our Form 10-Q reflects $25 million of value to be realized in future periods. Turning to energy, the energy investment segment, the variance explanation will be procurement for a while due to the sale of AGL Networks or dark fiber telecommunications business. We continue to make excellent progress on building our Golden Triangle storage facility in Texas and are planning to begin initial commercial operation for the facility in September. Last year we had the opposite effect, which is that we had hedged gains on both storage and transportation hedge positions during the quarter. As you know we have operated that business for about 10 years and while it was profitable it did not fit into our core strategy and so we capitalized on an opportunity to sell it to a company that is primarily focused in the telecommunications business and is better able to make more significant capital investments towards growing the business in the future.","About $14.5 million of the synergies component and it’s a policy question for the commission to deal with whether they want to encourage AGL that way to be a acquirer because the utility customers have benefited from AGLs acquisition over the years. So in terms of market dynamics we are seeing right now, our business befitting in a commercial activity standpoint from those two areas. Operator (Operator Instructions) your next question is from the line of Ryan Rosenthal from Sidoti Ryan Rosenthal Sidoti & Company My question concerns your wholesale service business and the dynamics we are seeing there in terms of the improvement in commercial activity, can you discuss kind of what you are seeing in terms of the forward curve right now. John Somerhalder Craig I will start out with development costs related to storage and what we have seen is development cost consistent with what we had anticipated. And we’ve shown and continued to show to be a very good operator of distribution operations and gas LDC and have a very good metrics related to how our cost benchmark against our competitors. John Somerhalder We’ve had very limited opportunities but important as an example we built Magnolia with El Paso that was only a little less than $50 million project but it’s still a nice contributor to EBIT and earnings. We’ve developed more diversity in our portfolio and our transportation activity has increased significantly in those two regions. Drew Evans Okay for the quarter its in the queue if you look at the, if you want to say, decreased usage and warmer than normal weather this quarter as well as the colder the normal weather last year, that’s the other thing to remember that variance also incorporates colder the normal weather last year, that was about $3 million and $3 million reduction due to plan in mixed component for the quarter. Gordon I don’t see any large transaction along those volumes that really fit as well with us, that’s not to say that won’t be the case in the future but at least till date we haven’t identified anything outside of those more defined discreet project that’s fit with our other infrastructure Gordon Howald East Shore Partners And all my other questions have been answered so I appreciate it. We have some taxes and other issues but that’s in line with what we had anticipated and then what we are spending to develop other projects that actually fairly see consistent with the last few years. First in the last quarter not only for you all but for other companies the size and duration of development costs for pursuing major storage expansion programs have come increasingly focused. Gordon Howald East Shore Partners Gentlemen would there be opportunities as given your background on the pipeline side, anything outside of the strict (LEC) environment. But the moment we think the case is just as solid as the day we filed it and you might recall the components but the base case is $18.5 million so traditionally rate case recoveries that we are seeking and several other things little over $7 million in depreciation which would be a cash recovery with no EBIT attached to it. In the forward market obviously the natural gas environment being impacted by lot of the shale activity, Haynesville, Marcellus and other significant shale developments. And secondly as we see the heat this summer we are seeing a lot more activity around serving power generation loads. Can you speak to the absolute level of development overhead costs for storage the trend of those costs over the next couple of years and whether we should anticipate any sunset or these costs would eventually go away as the gas storage is brought online. I’m curious about that given the dynamics for the shale play seems to be narrowing those spreads overtime. Ted Durbin Goldman Sachs I guess the first question is just saying about the SouthStar side of thing, you had a transaction announced not really ago to actually sell some storage would you consider monetizing your position is the market does people kind of content with this assets is something that you start getting out whether it’s Golden Triangle or Jefferson potential. And finally as a $13.5 million in service enhancement that we like to do for technology and customer service quality over the next year or two so it’s those component sometime with spending with recoveries and sometime with just a entry for depreciation base case is $18.5 million of the $54 million is the more traditional view. We are planning on that trend to continue. Sequent is very active in providing services to those producers and so we are seeing a lot more commercial activity around that activity to support those producers’ growing volumes in shale. Drew Evans Craig I think I understand your question which is what’s the run rate for development and at what point you stop developing and I think pivotal is a segment for us that’s bit of a corporation in its own right and a number of the expenses that they are incurring will also be important from the ongoing maintenance and operation of these assets and so rather than seeing some large cost reductions we will likely see a transfer of time commitment and materials to these operating assets as opposed to a focus on development but I would say we are spending a whole technical lot on looking for new storage opportunities, some but not a significant number if you look at the pivotal expenses. Drew Evans Ted at this point really over the next 6-9 months we are in a really early development phase on that but importantly there is several things that have lined up very well for us and that is that we own and operate LNG infrastructure and importantly as an example where and Elba Island is located, they have access to LNG that can be trucked to a large southeast very efficiently. Now I will break it into several different categories but one category relates to the actual construction cost at the facility and Golden Triangle as an example, those costs had been fairly consistent over the last year of what we had anticipated. But that I think gives you a good view of the commercial activity that we are seeing. John Somerhalder Ted right now we feel like it’s a very good fit with the rest of our business if you look at our distribution operations business which makes up about 70% of our income and then the balance we have with retail and with our wholesale business and the experience we have in those businesses it’s a good fit both from a standpoint of size of that business and what we think we can grow to as well as how it fits with our understanding of our natural gas market in total so at this point no, we are looking to further develop Jefferson Island and built out Golden Triangle and that’s our plan. What we’ve seen is we not only have the climate change benefits of 25% 30% reduction in carbon footprint with relative price of oil and gas right now with almost 3 to 1 you have a huge cost advantage and the technology has moved significantly and that’s what we are be looking into very quickly as the technology related not only the engines but in the storage but the technology has moved significantly giving ranges closer to where a diesel truck is. The area is a little bit of challenge could be where transportation portfolio, it could be negatively impacted because of the additional shale so it’s a little bit of offset to those benefits. Something unrelated to my background HRX was a good project for us but only those few cases that really fit with our infrastructure it doesn’t seem like we have a competitive advantage or real ability to enter so. Peter Tumminello And where you will see some of the basis spread widening or in areas typically where this is not as much as shale activity in the Midwest and the western part of our portfolio and so as we’ve grown that business over the last four or five years. Ryan Rosenthal Sidoti & Company Following up on that, in your release you did mention that you did see some widening transportation basis right at the starting of the quarter."

Finally, as you think about third quarter results for the wholesale segment, just a reminder that Sequent recorded $30 million in combined transportation and storage hedge gains in the third quarter of 2010. Operating margin was higher by $8 million, largely driven by $17 million of higher commercial activity offset by lower hedge gains. We remain on track with the Nicor merger approval process and we look forward to providing additional updates as they become available. The improvement was due to increased revenue at Golden Triangle Storage which we put into commercial operation in the third quarter of last year. However, our storage rollout position for the remainder of the year is now lower than it was at this time last year. So acquiring well located Texas storage capacity makes sense. Retail accounted for 22%, wholesale for 9% and energy investments for the remainder I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our Distribution business on Slide 6. Sequent continues to focus on servicing the core gas-fire generation market as well as expanding its other customer business in Texas. The distribution business performed quite well during the first half relative to expectations and we anticipate that this trend will continue through the remainder of the year. While abundant supply has positive long-term implications for our industry and business, abundant storage combined with historically low spreads creates a challenging environment in the short- term. Now that we have been through the financial details for the second quarter, let me update you on a few of our other major initiatives, including the Nicor merger approval process which is outlined on Slide 11. Sequent continues to face the challenges of lower market volatility and lower price differentials for storage and transportation, but our diversified approach continued to service well through the first half of the year. In the storage business during the quarter we added new contracts at both Golden Triangle Storage and Jefferson Island Storage & Hub. On Slide 9, you can see that our energy nvestment segment had a slight improvement during the quarter as compared to last year. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. The improvement in year-over-year earnings is largely reflective of strong performance in our utility business through a combination of reasonable rate case outcomes and infrastructure investment we have made to maintain and enhance the safety and reliability of our system. We saw modest improvement in commercial activity during the second quarter relative to the prior year period, but the main driver for Sequent’s year-over-year improvement was the fact that we had $8 million in hedge gains during this year’s second quarter associated with hedges on our storage and transportation positions. During the second quarter, Sequent executed a 2 Bcf storage agreement with GTS Cavern 1, effective June 1, 2011 for a five-year term. However, we expect to partially mitigate these impacts by continuing to grow our asset portfolio, build our fee-based services and maintain our focus on expense control as we support growth in these areas. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. On the construction and development front, we continue to make good progress on the second Cavern at Golden Triangle Storage and remain on track to have it in service in early 2012. Further, Sequent adds to the reputable customer portfolio that GTS is cultivating and that it’s an active participant providing gas supply services to the wholesale market. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-Q and 10-K. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. We remain on track for closing the transaction by year end and our integration planning efforts are focused on ensuring we are operationally ready in the event that we are granted expedited approval. As we noted in our 10-Q, we are finalizing documentation with various institutional investors for $275 million in funding through the private placement market in five and seven-year tranches, which we expected to take care of the short-duration portion of the curve for our financing activity related to the Nicor merger. This new GTS storage lease along with Sequent’s other contractual assets in Texas will allow Sequent to continue to grow this business. Operating expenses in the distribution segment increased just 2% and that was mainly driven by higher payroll and benefit costs associated with hiring new customer service employees, consistent with our commitment we made during the Atlanta Gas Light rate case. We’ve been diversifying Sequent’s business by focusing on fee-based services, power generation supply and producer services among other initiatives, which should help us mitigate the impacts of low volatility on the business. Sequent has produced strong results today despite a tough environment for wholesale and asset optimization businesses. Looking at our current storage rollout schedule at the end of the second quarter, Sequent had $11 million of economic value, which is $14 million below last year at this same time. The preliminary process for expansion at Jefferson Island is also ongoing, although further capital spending on storage projects will depend on storage market conditions. The positive of this result is that we had strong commercial activity during the first half of the year and affectively monetized many of our positions.","We also back on storage as you pointed out, another good thing about the Nicor businesses is the projects that they have looked at and or have opportunities around are more in the category of lower turn reservoir storage. Pete and Sequent have been able to capture some value on that especially in certain areas where we uniquely hold transportation portfolios, like in upper mid-Atlantic and further up in the East, but it’s been somewhat limited. It does connect very well with the storage positions we take with the asset management transactions that we have in our portfolio and allows us to serve the power plants on the multi-cycle needs and the high service demands that power generators have. As some of our co-existing customers are expanding their reach and growing their volumes, we’re working to continue to keep our preferred supplier-provider position in place with them and grow our volumes with them as they’re growing. Essentially what we’ve seen so far this year, even though things aren’t getting lower from the standpoint of the value of storage services, they have leveled out at a low level and they’ve really not shown much improvement, even though we’ve had cold weather this winter and we’ve had some hot weather so far mixed in, in the summer. However, what we try to do is make sure that in all other areas we find efficiencies to do the best job to offset those cost increases and we’ve been fairly successful in that range and I’ll turn it over to Hank for more detail. The improvement year-over-year it’s a lot rate case and a lot other infrastructure programs, not just Atlanta Gas Light, but in New Jersey as we mentioned in the prepared remarks and so we’re seeing opportunities for infrastructure investment across the enterprise that have mechanisms tied to them and we think that trend will continue and so we find it to be encouraging that we can expand our system, serve new loads and replace old parts of the system and have mechanisms to deal with that. On the gas storage business, I just want to understand a little bit more about the contracting here. If the storage market continues to show the commercial values we're seeing right now, we plan to be very disciplined and only spend what we need to, to keep our opportunities to expand at Jefferson Island and at Golden Triangle well positioned, but not to allocate capital to that until the market improves. And then on cost controls, just as John said, we’re tracking about where we think we should be, but broadly and not just inside the utility, but service providers in AGL that provide services to utility are all managing costs very effectively and it’s really helping the performance for the year. So it really is not any one item that will replace if we don’t have investment in storage. That’s really when it started it was 2008 when the economy turned and consumers started focusing more in the retail sector on value propositions and like I’ve said this occurred in our retail sectors, not just energy or natural gas specifically, so it’s pretty broad. Are we, I mean do these contracts represent kind of better rates than we’ve seen in the past or are things kind of bottoming out, kind of give us an idea of kind of how this process took place? I'll say this, we are seeing probably over the next two to three years an approximate 40% to 50% reduction, say three years from now of our transportation and storage demand cost roll-off from where we are now. It really is a balance between our utility business and these other opportunities that I've talked about, but you are also right about the one last item and I am making this probably too long of an answer, but we do continue to see a trend towards interest in using natural gas for transportation and whether that’s using some of our liquefied natural gas infrastructure to supply on-road and off-road heavy-to-heavy transportation or larger engines, or even a trend towards using more for personal vehicles, it really has shown positive signs, although it’s too early to allocate a lot of our attention and resources and growth plans to that, although it’s something we’re following very closely. Peter Tumminello Yeah Ted, we've really been able to find some significant opportunities on the transportation side of the business. In distribution operations a little above, but in total very much down the middle so far after six months. I guess, since the storage build out used to be a couple years ago the longer-term growth driver plan for the business, my big picture question is, what are the longer-term drivers, what are the opportunities looking past the great situation with the Nicor merger? There is an awful lot of transportation contracts that are expiring really throughout the country and Sequent has been very active working with pipelines and securing additional term transportation to diversify our portfolio in really all regions of the country, not just East but in the Midwest and the West as well. We think that's a very nice balance between contracts we entered into in the past, recent contracts we've entered into, how much capacity Sequent holds and manages, but you are right. We think that can be successful, so we’re focused on it, but we’re really looking at those things I mentioned first as the drivers of growth if we don’t have the return to a normal level of volatility that we’ve seen in the past on storage and by the way, we still feel very good when the market is back and balanced. So to the extent we continue to have the success that we’re having acquiring new contracts on the power generation side, we will continue to need currently the base of contracts we have and likely a growing base of storage contracts to help support the customer side of our business. John Somerhalder Craig, the other question is the question we focus on the most heavily and that is that related to storage, I mean to start out with, we're very happy with the portfolio of contracts we now have with Jefferson Island and Golden Triangle. It’s very oversupplied now with storage and flowing gas. As far as cost control, we are not quite that precise on an exact target. We’ve seen enough gas in storage and enough flowing gas that the volatility has been limited. We have more agreements in place with producers and with power plants that we think can mitigate that. Sorry, I knew you had given a little bit of detail on the producer services segment earlier, but I was jumping between calls. So, I do expect over time that our full demand charge, portfolio storage and transport to be fairly constant over that time period. And then second question, a peer that has a lot of gas storage capacity had at least on that side a big miss this morning, although the MLP did very well and clearly we’re seeing lower contracted rates at GTS. So that continues to grow in line with what we’ve described in prior meetings and then our gas supply for power generation is also just an anchor for what we are trying to do. And then are you still really aggressively trying to grow, I think you had said 8% to 10% growth in kind of your transportation contract, but we're seeing still very tight basis differentials. We've seen slightly positive results relative to our guidance in Distribution operations for the reasons Drew mentioned earlier, and we've seen a little bit more pressure on the SouthStar business because of weather and the migration of customers to some lower margin plans, but not by a larger amount. Peter Tumminello Yeah Carl, Dish as well as other storages are very integral to our integrated approach of serving customers and primarily storage in particular facilities, soft cabin facilities are instrumental in helping to balance the intra-day needs of power generation load. And even though the market is depressed now, we see a better opportunity to potentially move some of those projects for us. We’ll be available the rest of the day, and if you have questions once you’ve made it through the 10-Q and looked at our materials in more detail. There is, we do see though two risks that we’re focused on, and that would be our businesses, both SouthStar’s business and Sequent’s business, and even distribution operations to a very limited extent. But we are also adding many new customers, many new producers to the mix as some more small-to-mid size independents are expanding their volumes in primarily the shale plays. Hank pointed out some projects to extend our system. We had a very strong roll-out scheduled this time than last year and we have the situation that volatility is low, but as Pete indicated he’s been able to get new transportation storage, redo asset management deals with better rates. We have invested in pipeline projects like HRS. We’re seeing significant growth in our producer services group that is working primarily with shale producers, be it in the Marcellus, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and in some of the new shales that we are seeing and we are able to secure production that fits well with our transportation and asset management portfolio there. First one maybe a little quicker for Pete and maybe second one, I don’t know if John or Pete want to talk a little about, but Pete, can you quantify how much built-in costs might be rolling off in the coming two or three years as your legacy of Sequent contracts roll off for storage and transport capacity and you're able to re-up that at lower market rates? Are we talking about transport fuels? John Somerhalder Not material. But in terms of organic growth in the business, if gas storage never comes back, are we talking about low turn storage, depleted reservoir? I just wanted to double check, the $8 million increase from Atlanta Gas Light, was that all attributable to the rate case or is some of that, some of the infrastructure replacement and then if you could also just talk to, talking about cost controls, do you have a target for how much cost inflation you expect on a year-over-year basis?"

I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 6. Turning to Slides 13 and 14, you can see an historical look at our storage rollout schedule along with the chart of current and historic storage spreads, reflecting the year-over-year wider storage spreads, in part due to the market needing an outlet for natural gas supply. Under the proposed plan, we would replace nearly 150 miles of pipe that is predominantly aging cast iron. The largest component of the EBIT decline came from a $6 million reduction in commercial activity versus the second quarter of 2011 due to ongoing low volatility in the storage and transportation spreads. However, additional lower cost or market inventory valuation adjustments could potentially offset a portion of the positive impact. The warm weather had a negative EBIT effect of approximately $4 million during the quarter across our distribution businesses. While revenues per unit were down, TEU, or 20-foot equivalent unit, shipments and market share are up relative to the same period last year, reflecting tropical strong profile in the region and efficient management of its business. The storage hedge losses we experienced in the second quarter added to the locked in storage rollout value at the end of the quarter. Retail operations accounted for 19% year-to-date, wholesale services, 3% and mid stream moderations, 1%. As Drew noted, our storage rollout value has improved to $47 million on about 55 Bcf of natural gas inventory. As a result, our storage hedge gains were strong on a year-over-year basis, but the portfolio is likely to be challenged for the remainder of the year unless basis widens. Based on Sequent's current projection of year-end storage positions at December 31, 2012 of about 25 Bcf, a $1 increase in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in a $24 million reduction to Sequent's reported operating revenues for this year, but would increase the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013 by a corresponding amount. This is due to a number of positive indicators we have seen through the first half of the year including cost containment and managing our controllable expenses, achieving our merger savings targets and generating incremental economic value in our wholesale business. On Slide 5, you can see that approximately 77% of the total consolidated operating EBIT for the first 6 months of 2012 was generated by our distribution operations segment. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-Qs, and they are more fully described in our most recent 10-K filings. As a reminder, we re-contracted 3 Bcf of capacity at Jefferson Island starting April 1. In our 10-Q filed this morning we have provided information about the impact of forward natural gas price changes on our storage portfolio. You can access these materials by visiting aglresources.com. We also recorded transportation hedge gains of $18 million during the quarter, a $14 million increase over the last year and storage hedge losses of $9 million as compared to $4 million of storage hedge gains last year, a $13 million negative year-over-year impact. The program we have proposed is consistent with our commitment to prudently invest capital on infrastructure programs that have minimum regulatory lag and enhance the reliability and integrity of our distribution system. Again, with the exception of weather, we are demonstrating solid results across our business units and we have reason for optimism as we look ahead to the remainder of 2012. We remain focused on controlling expenses across the corporation, and we are seeing positive trends in that regard in several of our businesses. Joining me on the call today from our distribution operations headquarters here in Naperville, Illinois are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO; Andrew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Due to the continued challenging market conditions and pressure on storage pricing, this dropped our average rate for the facility from $0.19 to $0.14. Briefly, the cargo shipping segment reported an EBIT loss of $1 million during the second quarter of 2012. I do want to point out that the situation with our transportation hedges is a bit different, however. Due to narrowing basis spreads, we accelerated transportation hedge gains of approximately $20 million into the first half of this year, primarily from the second half of 2012 through 2013. Forward-looking statements involve matters that are not historical facts and our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from the actual results. We have continued to improve the locked-in value of our storage rollout by capturing the year-over-year higher storage spreads by injecting gas and by rolling our storage positions to later periods. As you can see, we have a significant storage rollout schedule of $47 million that we expect to recognize in operating revenues about equally between the remainder of 2012 and 2013.","On the rest of the margins in our distribution and operations business, the weather has already impacted us in the most significant time period, the first quarter and part of the second quarter. I don't know if Pete's on the line, but I understand that we have this really anomalous all-time record storage position that just cratered short-term gas prices and as we started to get our arms around that problem, the seasonal spreads and an anomalous condition really widened. I mean I guess to sort of focus on your question directly, we are exceeding our expectations in terms of our abilities to make for a more efficient operation. It's very consistent with the high priority of continuing to upgrade our pipeline system, which we have done in many jurisdictions. At the same time, we have got these transportation costs where we have had earlier hedge gain that we have got to cover now these transportation costs. All these issues kind of surround a little more the salt dome storage, and I understand that you guys are holding back a little bit on further expansions in the salt dome storage until you can see improving pricing in the market out there. I mean with the drilling pullback there is a little bit of the gas generation burn, do you think that that's a trend that's kind of flattening and the build is going to -- that's going to continue or is there a lot of gas kind of out there waiting for resolution of the infrastructure [indiscernible]? Related to North Louisiana, on the Sawgrass facility, which is our 50-50 joint project, right now, we are just going to be kind of in a hold pattern there. We build inventories significantly faster and at significantly lower costs than we did at this time last year. If there is a warm winter, we are going to benefit again next year with widening spreads and if there is a cold winter, we will benefit on transport. Henry Philip Linginfelter Former Executive Vice President of Distribution Operations Yes, I would just add to that, Carl, that we will see over time, as we have in every transaction, additional value creation through synergies, whether it's standardization, which we have an exercise around that across the enterprise for operations. If we have a very cold winter, we are obviously hedged on that storage, we will take that out of the ground and realize those earnings and then our transport portfolio would benefit at that time. Peter I. Tumminello Group President of Commercial Businesses Craig, as you are aware, we just put into service our Central Valley storage facility in California, the 11 Bcf facility out there and although storage across the country is challenged, there is some unique things about California that we actually like. But what -- I think the surprise for the entire industry has been we all expected that there would be more power generation burn because of the lower gas prices. That's kind of the counterbalance to our storage position compared to just having a warm summer weather or cold winter weather where the storage is more valuable just to balance the market. Generally, looking out at the weekly storage data, obviously, it's still a pretty strong comps versus last year and historically, but the, I guess, the rate of builds is slowing down a little bit and I know some of that's coming from gas burn from generation. We are also seeing where in California there has been a denial of some new projects to get built due to some regulatory constraints in historical San Bruno. So although prices kicked in significantly greater power generation, weather has had that impact too. We are going to keep the project alive. You have issues in Western Canada where you are almost full already in storage and you are starting to see some bottlenecking of supplies out there versus the Gulf Coast. The only other thing I will add is, this summer we are seeing the heat more dispersed throughout the country than last year where we saw it mainly in Oklahoma and Texas, and that storage is being able to return a little bit more this year as well, which isn't a rollout schedule issue. At the same time, we are getting ready to head into a time period where power generation is not as significant part of the load as we get to later September and October. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO Craig, as Drew mentioned, if we just look at, compared to our expectation, with the merger closing late in December and the holidays, we started slightly later than we had originally anticipated, but I would say that with the run rate we are seeing now and what we have already accomplished through the first half of year, that it is trending in a positive direction and we think the results for the year will be on the positive side of what we originally have projected, which is a positive sign. But how do you feel about the opportunities on your inherited depleted reservoir storage and have you reconsidered at all possibly moving forward with that even while the salt dome situation kind of lays in limbo? It was -- Carl, it was 3 out of I think a total of little over 7 and it did represent some of the higher priced contracts rolling off because of the timing of when those were entered in kind of at the peak of storage values back 3 or 4 years ago. The way I would just add to John's comment is that we have seen this every few years when it is -- when you come out of a very warm winter and the way we look at it going into this winter if we have another warm winter, we could see even more extreme spreads next year due to the severe overhang of natural gas supply. That could bring a little bit of volatility to our earnings in the third quarter, but generally the use of that -- or total storage level is going to be about equal at the end of the year. Carl Ludwig Kirst BMO Capital Markets U.S. Actually just one clarifying question off of storage. We still have some room in that, reduced injection provides more flexibility in the system, but the wild card to me is going to be weather as we just go through the balance of the summer and we could get to the situation where we get full early if the weather pulls back some. Can you remind us, this is on the distribution side, I guess we saw $60 million of O&M per meter down from $75 million, certainly a nice drop. So we have seen the storage spreads narrow more than what we had anticipated up to this point. So the rate of growth and storage has to decline relative to the sort of the slope of that line last year. However, when you look at the Sequent business, you see the strong rollout schedule and you see the fact that we have seen so far this summer, some additional hot weather, other than certainly what was projected and across more of the country. That yields more efficient operations. So there are projections that say it could fill up again rather quickly especially since, if you look at production, the other thing that's happened is production, even though the rig count has come off significantly, production hasn't fallen as quickly as some people had predicted. When you look at our employees out, you're actually taking care of the pipeline, taking care of our employees, those numbers are staying relatively flat. So I think that's a long way of saying, we really don't know, but there are dynamics where even though we have narrowed that storage overhang, so far through this summer that it's possible we still could see pretty tight storage at the end of the year. It pretty much moves out right in front of you in the current year as you see high storage levels and the need to use storage to absorb some of the supply. So, we are reducing costs where we can through the efficiencies of shared services and some other areas and we are in line at this point, as Drew indicated, it's a good indicator that we are in line with what we talked about with the merger savings that we targeted. The other issue is that not all of the benefits of being a combined business are showing up exclusively in the distribution business. But you are right; the forward curve usually doesn't pick that value up until you actually get to where you see a more immediate storage overhang or the opposite could occur if you see shortage of storage and volatility for that reason, and Pete has a more direct exposure to that. Our storage plans don’t change much in terms of its exit level towards year-end and it’s interesting to see. Also the ability to capture supply chain benefits over time and systems integrations where we can do that that gives us spreading those fixed costs over a larger footprint. We see a positive run rate trend and the potential for some positive on that, but not a material number at this time, but it is positive."

Taking a closer look at each segment, a snapshot of second quarter EBIT for our distribution business is on Slide 5. We have filed an agreement with staff and expect a ruling from the Georgia Commission in early August on our request to replace 750 miles of plastic pipe. Importantly, we continue to improve market share and utilization with volume that is higher by 11% year-over-year through June. In our case, this means that we can deploy -- potentially deploy up to $150 million annually to upgrade our pipeline system. These discrete items are in addition to our effective cost control and slight margin improvements relative to expectations across most of our business segments. However, excluding these items as well as additional expense associated with the acquisition of warranty customers earlier this year, our O&M expenses decreased slightly, and we continue to maintain our focus on controlling costs. So we would be looking at about $200 million of CapEx, which would remain subject to normal rate-setting process and potentially an additional $150 million under the new surcharge program. Excluding weather, we achieved growth in our operating margins during the first half of the year, primarily as a result of continued investment in our regulated infrastructure programs, targeted acquisition growth in retail operations and higher contribution from commercial activity in our wholesale segment. As we have mentioned previously, market fundamentals remain challenging for this business segment due to low natural gas price volatility, abundant market supplies and associated low seasonal storage spreads. Briefly, you can see results for the cargo shipping segment on Slide 9. In Georgia, we are working on Phase 2 of our STRIDE program related to pipeline enhancements and system expansions at Atlanta Gas Light. The storage rollout schedule at the end of June was $14 million compared to $47 million at the end of the same period in 2012. As expected, our operations and maintenance expense in 2013 increased as a result of returning to targeted levels in incentive compensation. Our distribution retail segments together contributed 94% of operating EBIT through the first 6 months of this year. The $33 million year-over-year reduction is reflective of the modernization of many of our storage positions as we withdrew natural gas from storage in the first half of this year. The $20 million variance is driven by an $11 million gain on the sale of Compass Energy, as we previously disclosed, and a $13 million improvement in commercial activity. These are all important programs for maintaining the safety and reliability of our system, and the rider-based programs have minimal regulatory lag for cost recovery. A significant capital investment would be good, stable cash flow into investment returns that are generally in line with our regulated returns in our utility businesses. Operations and maintenance expense increased 28% year-over-year for the quarter and 11% for the first half of the year, due primarily to the acquisition of approximately 500,000 warranty contracts in January of this year. Slightly colder-than-normal weather resulted in a $0.02 positive impact across our distribution and retail segments during the quarter. Retail operations and cargo shipping were in line with last year's second quarter, and EBIT for midstream operations declined by $2 million year-over-year. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. With our bare steel and cast iron replacement now largely complete, we are looking to replace aging plastic pipeline in our footprint. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and more fully described in today's 10-Q filing. In Illinois, 2 impactful pieces of legislation were approved by the general assembly in May, and one was signed into law by the governor in July. As I mentioned on our last call, we continue to evaluate options for meeting our natural gas supply and infrastructure needs in Georgia. Forward-looking statements involve matters that are not historical facts, and our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from our actual results. As a result, when contracts expire, we have been either recontracting at lower rates reflective of the current market or utilizing in-house management capabilities to optimize the assets until conditions improve to support longer-term contracts. Consolidated EBIT was up 29% year-over-year, driven by improvements in our distribution and wholesale segments. For the first half of the year, EBIT, the wholesale segment, has improved by $16 million year-over-year, driven primarily by the gain on the sale of Compass as well as stronger commercial activity. Also, under the STRIDE umbrella, tomorrow, we expect to file an updated construction and investment plan for continued system reinforcement and customer growth projects. As we discussed in our analyst day, our primary exposure to weather in the distribution operations segment is at Nicor Gas since we do not have weather normalization mechanisms in place. And I'll just reiterate Drew's comment that mark- to-market accounting related to storage and transportation hedge movements can have a meaningful impact on our wholesale business, making it more difficult to forecast results for that segment on a GAAP basis. These are natural gas commodity customers who opt for competitive service in the state. While we are tracking in line with our targets for the wholesale business, mark-to-market accounting movements on transportation and storage hedges associated with this segment made consolidated GAAP EPS for the full year more difficult to forecast. Consolidated EBIT increased 18% year-over- year with improvements in all segments, excluding midstream operations. We remain in discussions with potential partners about taking an equity stake in an interstate pipeline project. The primary year-over-year drivers of the $0.11 increase were improved commercial activity in our wholesale services segment, the previously disclosed sale of Compass, which added $0.04 during the quarter and additional margin improvement of approximately $0.04 at distribution operations. First, we have about a $0.05 benefit due to colder-than-normal weather across our distribution and retail businesses through June. In order to reduce the potential for negative fourth quarter 2013 earnings impacts from weather, we thought it would be prudent to enter into this cost-effective transaction. In order to claim full recovery of capital deployed under this program, we would still be required to spend approximately $200 million in capital under base rates, which is roughly our 5-year average CapEx at Nicor Gas. The midstream segment declined -- decline year-over-year is due largely to the roll-off of legacy contracts that were above current market rates as well as higher depreciation, property taxes and other storage-related expenses due to additional facilities and service when compared to the second quarter of last year.","And the same is true of the energy portion of the business where we were serving about 80,000 customers in Illinois. But as Pete indicates, because we well positioned ourselves with power generation and pipeline capacity out of some of the shale areas where there's been some constraints, we are still seeing a reasonable opportunity to make money in those areas and the fact that our competitors are leaving in other areas and some of the same areas we're in, it is a slight positive. We focused on it from the standpoint of investing the capital, and you talk about it from a return component. Do you see any implications from Twin Oak's [ph] decision mid-last month to wind down its energy services operations amidst this continued weakness in salt dome storage and the regional basis differentials? To really give you a good sense of what that number is, that'll be a matter of public record in pretty short order. We think, though, that in order to meet the timeline and schedules of the parties that very much need additional gas in the state of Georgia, that those decisions will have to be finalized over just the next several weeks. And we would not want to count on, like you say, interruptible transportation or future contracting on that base project. We have a large concentration with gas-fired power generation customers that we serve, and we've got a concentration of pipeline capacity that serves producers out of the shales. So that is, I think, is the right way to think about the cash flow in it of the proposal. So it would really be in line with the expansion, not really counting on other value that you'd get from interruptible transportation or those things. If I could actually just cue off of some of Ted's questions and maybe first on the pipeline side, and I just want to make sure I'm understanding. We know as part of getting a pipeline project built, you might have to look at returns that were more in line with our utility returns in early years. So that would be an incremental investment from the cash flow, from the existing. So we see it working well for our customers, well for our cash flow, works well for our growth rate, and it does then have the EPS impact on a noncash basis, as you said, the end of this year and on a full year run rate starting next year. But in the meantime, we've already got our engineering and construction function working on a very good, prudent project that we could deploy capital, that we would file next year after all the rules are set in advance of the commission's ability to deal with those so that we could execute as quickly as we prudently could after we're authorized to do so. And then we have this sort of alphabet soup of new projects that potentially come online here. And then, John, I guess, just the sort of discussion around co-investing in the long-haul pipeline. We've got a different structural setup with the management of all of our affiliated assets. And that is we would at least want to make sure that we have long-term contracts on a pipeline project that moved us close to those type of returns. And this was an opportunity really just to move customer contracts into the portfolio and again, do nothing more than have better utilization of the underlying infrastructure that we had in the service list of customers. There's always the possibility of an appeal that the order from the ICC was very direct, including around the ICC's discretion around the issue, which we think fairly well strengthens the order for an appeal, and yet we didn't agree with everything in that order. And so, Drew, kind of recognizing what you're saying that these assets may be a little bit different, a little bit unique considering the storage, the one number I just wanted to confirm, perhaps factual number, is that relative to the rest of the LDCs, is that average depreciation rate, if I got my number correctly, at 2.6%? I mean, we believe that very soon, we'll be able to announce whether it's possible for us to invest on a pipeline project and to talk to you about if a deal can be structured. John, even as we may have a escalation over time to a FERC rate, at least in one potential scenario, whatever you guys do decide to invest if there is a return component that matches the utility, that would be a base contracted return, right? And that is over the long run, we would expect FERC allowed to return on that type of pipeline investment to be above what we see with the utility. Andrew William Evans Former Director We haven't seen any activity yet from the parties. But once those parameters are set up, we'll know then what fits, doesn't fit in a program that we'd like to propose. They've been encouraged to do so through the legislative process. What -- how should we think about a reasonable D&A rate versus the 4.1% you're currently booking? And our goal would to be very tied on that timing so that we are getting these projects in for system reliability and safety for our customers, and we're deploying capital so that we can earn return on them. There are a couple of more complex assets, particularly storage assets, that had much higher removal costs than what we typically see. And it seems like that's been kind of the -- that pipeline replacement has been a big driver of the year-over-year improvement in earnings. And so for us, we aren't impacted as greatly as some of the others that just have made more 1 or 2 regional components to their business as we're were more spread out and get to participate in movements that we're seeing in some of the shale regions. Ideally, fairly minor cash flow -- only cash flow impact is from the extent we would invest additional capital to do some of the programs we need to do on the state. I'm kind of -- if there's a delay or kind of what the impact is of the base, call it, pipeline replacement program coming off and how much that's impacted earnings this year and then how it falls through to '14. They were opposed to the stipulation as well as they did not support the commission's final order, but we're not aware of any activity yet on appeal side. The #1 focus is just to get utilization of those fleet up to historical levels. But short run on cash flow, it shouldn't have an impact except to the extent, and John hit on it earlier, that we now have the opportunity to invest some additional capital. It really would just reflect a larger project where you have to build the first phase, still get a reasonable return, but the expansion would be where you really get up to the full FERC returns. The offset is the challenge in the storage market. But as Hank indicated, we don't think it's a material delay, and it actually works pretty well with timing to make sure we have the best program in place and we can ramp up the engineering and all of the contracting around making sure we're ready to go. So we do expect to be able to answer that question, Carl, in very short order. And on retail, can you guys maybe expound on the acquisition-related activities in terms of the growth we're seeing, the integration efforts and maybe future M&A? Andrew William Evans Former Director I don't know that we've disclosed much detail because it's not overly material, and that will amortize affectively over the next couple of quarters. As we're seeing some benefit through competitors leaving business, we're still in a very challenging storage market at this point. But in general, the way we're looking at this is, and the way we'd analyze this, it will not change the cash flow to us compared to our base plan without a change in depreciation. We've seen a couple of competitors leave a couple of particular ports that we serve. But we also need to go to the ICC and show a list of projects that make sense or that meet our pipeline safety and other needs. But what I""m trying to get my head around is, wouldn't in the next year or 2, that lead in a short run to lower operating cash flow as ratepayers don't have to divvy up as much over time for the depreciation on the legacy rate base, that $1.5 billion that you guys were talking about before? And perhaps then just sort of a -- obviously, we can't talk about numbers now, but is it safe to say then whatever level of participation should this project move forward that, that has been then now already hammered out amongst the owners? But in one case, it would be a situation where you would earn a good return under the -- with the original construction of the facility. The pipeline replacement CapEx, it's falling off in 2013 at Atlanta Gas Light."

You can see that the gains on storage and transportation hedges combined were $117 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to $11 million during the same quarter last year, where natural gas prices during the quarter were decreasing but not with at the rate that we saw this year. Prospectively we are seeing declines in natural gas prices, this spurts well for customers and we are likely [inaudible] to deliver the majority of our gas out of the inventory. On the inventory side our price decreased below the weighted average cost of our inventory requires us to write down the inventory to its current market value. In addition to the non-GAAP measures in our earnings release we provided consolidated earnings results that exclude the impacts of hedge gains, losses in our wholesale services segment and also excluding the required inventory valuation adjustments for our wholesale services and retail energy segment. However, in light of the current economic conditions we do not plan to move forward on this project this time. And with the progress we have made to date on the cavern well, the brine disposal wells in the surface facilities including the leech plant, we expect to move to a very important phase of the project and that is leech of cavern number one as early as in the middle of December. You will also see the $34 million LOCOM adjustment that resulted from valuing our national gas inventory and storage at market prices which were lower than the average weighted price we paid to buy the gas. More importantly, we have made significant progress on three of our growth projects during the third quarter; on Hampton Roads Crossing, Golden Triangle Storage and Magnolia. If you think about our standard operation of segment these movements can be highly anticipated, we inject gas into the ground in the summer and locking a margin by selling a forward contract. We have not seen material consolidation in our bank group with the exception of Wachovia and Wells Fargo. We have some minor, we did have some minor damages from the hurricanes in September, but nothing had caused any material delay or cost increases. As we allocate and prioritize our capital in this current economic environment we will place the highest priority on regulated projects in our distribution operations business where projects with a more regulated quality of earnings or projects that support or provide services to some of our own utilities. We've already discussed the big drivers in distribution ops and the fact that we've seen lower customer growth and a little bit higher bad debt expense. We maintain sizable buffers, built significant liquid inventories and have excellent diversification across our bank group. The various factors that could cause such a material difference are included in our press release and our 10-Q filing and are more fully described in our most recent 10- K filing. Turning to the retail energy segment, SouthStar as you know the third quarter is not typically a big earnings driver for that business at least from an operating standpoint. The commercial activity line which is generally the way you can gauge economic value created and recognized during a particular period shows good improvement over last year up $16 million. I can now tell you that this project is on the salt-dome in Louisiana and we have named it Triple Diamond Storage. We had purchased much of the steel and another materials needed for the project and as a result our exposure to any rise in commodity prices is now limited on this project. Before we move on to the prepared remarks, let me just remind you that our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In summary, even though we have decided to not move forward with our Triple Diamond Storage dollar project. That said, our Distribution Operations business will generate more than $800 million worth of operating margin in any given year. At the time we were too early in the development project to share many details about the project. In no case, as the underlying profitability of the position changed, its just at the full value of the storage transaction is not completely realized until the gas in storage is delivered. This is below our cost of market or LOCOM inventory valuation adjustment. And we just recently completed one of the most interesting and difficult aspects of the project that's a 7000 plus for directional drill under the Elizabeth River. Once written down the inventory cannot be adjusted back up if prices subsequently increase. The other factor affecting third quarter earnings is that in a declining price environment we are required to value our natural gas inventory at the lower of a weighted average cost for the prevailing market price. In most instances a decrease in price will increase the value before the forward sale and be substantially offset by decrease in the value of the inventory. A good example is our Magnolia pipeline project which will provide transportation of reclassified LNG from Elba Island to Atlanta Gas Light in the making in Atlanta areas. We still believe in the strong fundamentals of the storage business and plan to take the necessary steps to preserve the options we have to develop this project in the future. We secured the potential site and have advanced that project to the point of doing the initial size of re-testing of the dome and all indications so far are positive about the geology of the site and similar to the Golden Triangle location, it had some significant competitive advantages and that it conserve a number of major Gulf Coast pipelines, pipelines like Tennessee type better transport and including Golden Pass in Gulf South and that's still a fairly small a header systems only about 30 mile gather system. In early summer we anticipated growing our credit capacity to maintain capital buffers in a high gas price environment. Turning to our capital projects; I will start with Hampton Roads Crossing project, HRX project in Virginia. We continue to make significant progress on Golden Triangle Storage at the project and around Vermont, Texas. We have received Georgia PSC and court approvals and have ordered major equipment and that is primarily compression in the third quarter and are moving forward with this $48 million project. We plan to preserve the options to develop this project at a later date. Earlier this year we discussed the potential new salt-dome storage project located in the Gulf Coast region. Our size gives us an advantage in sourcing capital. The inventory rollout schedule on page 24 of the 10-Q gives you our best current view of when we expect to realize the future economic value of Sequent storage portfolio.","John W. Somerhalder II I'mtrying to make sure I don't quote a bad number on this but in total if the bulk we're having you are talking about 20% of the cost or so of the project is... it might may be off a little bit is tied up in pad gas but we don't need that pad gas in closer to your... until closer to the end service. And our Jefferson Island expansion is a very good project with that location close to the Henry Hub. We don't have any material maturities in our bond portfolio till 2011. And if I could, just one other question, you noted that you scaled back on one of your expansion projects and are going to focus on regulated projects at least for the foreseeable future, big picture John, what do you see with energy related capital projects industry wide, just given credit turmoil given the economic problems that we're in, situations like that... That would be a very high storage priority. The hurricanes did not materially impact our cost but they did add a little bit of cost. In terms of the distribution, what sort of the opportunity to bring down the O&M to offset some of the customer growth or the weakness in customer growth you are seen maybe you can give us little more detail there? There are significant projects that absolutely need to get build but that is much harder to build them in this environment, I mean I think everyone saw the announcement on board walk and the fact that their parents going to step forward and make sure that gets done but there will be some others that will be challenged. Our mobility system which is how we dispatch our crews and workforce in the field that all those things we continue to see some mass opportunities for improvements in the underlying cost to running the business and we'll execute on those. At this point we don't see a big benefit of doing that, but we would be closer to meeting a gas to fill the caverns and to put the pad gas and we will definitely look at that. I mean how do you see capital spending, for the near term for in the energy space overall? But that short term debt is back stocked by our revolver and the total capacity that we have under those things is $1.28 billion and so our utilization is $768 million of it. Gordon Howald Calyon Securities Regarding, I guess Carl touched on this, regarding the existing storage projects, what is the pad gas requirements, when are they required and with gas prices is down is there any benefit that you will receive to hedging those gas... pad gas storage requirements at this point? John W. Somerhalder II On the gist litigation, we are in the process now of going through the depositions. John W. Somerhalder II We've, as an example, we still strongly believe in the fundamentals of storage in the medium to long term and what we have seen at least what we've seen directly in what a number of people that do consulting work for us have told us is that a number of people developing storage projects are slowing down or delaying projects. John W. Somerhalder II Well on Magnolia, most of the cost are locked in because essentially what we are doing is using existing pipe its already in the ground. Have you look around here there has been some speculation perhaps the down draft in the equity markets might re-stimulate some consolidation kind of throughout the industry much, much less the energy E&P. So, what we're really looking toward is looking at the investment we've made in our distribution operations and those rate cases, rather than only cost cutting. We have also looked at a list of capital projects that MLPs have on their backlog. We've been very aggressive through our call centers, when people are having difficulty paying bills to focused them on federal dollars likely dollars to make sure that they have some capacity to pay in the winter heating season that's our first priority, first and foremost. So we really haven't had to make dollars go on yet but the costs are locked in we don't expect much movement on that because it's mostly existing pipe in the ground. We locked in some line pipe and casing and even though we got it at a price consistent with the estimate of 10% to 20% higher, that we didn't get any benefit from that. You think about storage builds, we build pretty significantly through November. So, we would attempt to find a way to move forward with that project. So we really do believe and even talking to you some of the big pipeline, they had great projects and its much more difficult as you all notice to fund those now. John W. Somerhalder II So it's the cost we are locking we really haven't spend those dollars there we have ordered the major piece of new equipment and that's compression, that's actually I believe only in a range of 10% of that project cost and for $4 million. So what we are doing is not inconsistent for similar reasons which I think that was well for value of the storage we are building, in the long term. We do, as I said we do believe in the fundamentals of storage.

We've also seen an increase in utility operations expensed year-to-date, primarily as a result of higher depreciation expense, as well as higher pension post retirement expenses. This withdraw will generate operating margin of $23 million. Our Hampton Roads Crossing, or what we call our HRX project, in Virginia, continues to go well with only a few minor construction delays. Based on our current projection for the year-end storage positions, a $1 increase in the first quarter 2010 forward NYMEX gas prices would result in a $9 million reduction to reported operating revenue for the year. In both the distribution and retail segments, keep in mind the third quarter is typically a shoulder period for us, representing only about 15% of our earnings in that period. Turning to our major capital projects, we continue to make good progress on both our regulated and our unregulated pipeline in storage projects. The factors that could cause such a material difference are included in our press release, in our 10-Q, and are more fully described in our most recent 10-K filing. And before we move to the prepared remarks, let me just remind you that our discussions today may contain forward-looking statements and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in those forward-looking statements. You may recall that this project is about $46 million investment, which includes the purchase of an undivided interest in some of Southern Natural Gas assets that we are combining with existing Atlanta Gaslight distribution pipeline to create a firm transportation path into the Atlanta market from the Elba Island LMG facility. These movements are unrelated to when we generate the value. In addition to the income we have already reported we have 26 million cubic feet of salt dome and reservoir storage at a weighted average in the $3.40 range, with 14 billion cubic feet schedule to be withdrawn in the first quarter of this year, I'm sorry in the fourth quarter of this year. Our liquidity position is strong, particularly given lower working capital requirements this year resulting from lower gas prices as we have build inventories throughout the injection season. Construction on our Golden Triangle storage facility in Texas also continues to go well and we are expecting to have the first cavern of that project online in the third quarter of 2010. We also have 10 billion cubic feet we expect to withdraw in the first quarter of 2010, which will produced operating margin of $18 million. First, we recognized commercial activity for the quarter was down $17 million relative to last year. The real story year-to-date is in distribution, is that operating margin is up $16 million, primarily as a result of carrying higher priced inventory on behalf of the marketers in Georgia and higher revenue from our pipeline improvement project in Atlanta Gas Light. You can find some very good schedules in the results of operation segment of our MD&A that reconcile you back to reported EBIT for each business unit. That's largely a function of $8 million in reduced margins, with $5 million of that associated with a network expansion project we completed and sold to a customer in 2008. If you recall, when we store gas in our system on behalf of the marketers in Georgia, we collect carrying charges on that inventory and since inventory levels and costs have been higher this year, our margins from that activity are higher than last year. Turning to energy investments, we have recorded year-to-date EBIT of $7 million, which is down $11 million relative to last year. Second, increasing gas prices during this year's third quarter resulted in a loss of $5 million on our storage hedges, compared to $105 million gain on storage hedges during the third quarter last year as prices declined significantly throughout the quarter. Last year's third quarter was a period in which we reported significant gains on storage hedges at Sequent, as a result of gas price movements in that quarter. Hank and his team have done a great job of holding in line on discretionary operating costs, particularly during a time when we were challenged by the market impacts of flat-to-negative customer growth, but clearly these two items have had the largest impact on us from an expense standpoint. As John pointed out, Sequent has been enable to take advantage of market opportunities to generate significant future economic value in its storage portfolio and you can see that in the storage rollout schedule we provide on page -- I think it's 29 in the 10-Q. We anticipate putting that project into commercial operations in December.","In terms of the weak energy demand we've seen over the last year and a half or so, and also relatively low natural gas prices, what's your outlook for the transportation spread business and do you see that recovering with an economic boost into 2010? That's our base plan and so we're actively working that right now, but sometime between now and the in service date we'll lock up that last 4 BCF of capacity. So we do anticipate that between now and the time it goes in service we will contract the additional 4 BCF of capacity. So we'll always keep the litigation option open until we have resolved a path towards that allows to expand the facility. We were able to sell one third of that capacity very early on at a very good rate we believe. And then the same thing when you come out, we'll take advantage of salt opportunities based on real time dynamics, while the reservoir storage has to come out evenly. So we did lock up that one-third of the capacity. In terms of thinking about it - in terms of the future, would you suggest that you can wait later in the cycle to, if margins are improving over time or is there a certain amount you look to lock in up front in terms of percentage of your raw storage? But, clearly we expect transportation spreads to be relatively tight. So we didn't pre-shape as much margin gain as we did on our salt storage. <strong>John W. Somerhalder II</strong> Yeah, for Golden Triangle the first cavern as you know, it's about 6 BCF, well it is 6 BCF capacity. <strong>Douglas N. Schantz</strong> Ryan, obviously, without weather and storms and other activity that kind of drive volatility, we've seen lower transportation spreads and we expect that to continue to a certain degree through next year. We try to minimize our [risk of] insurance premiums and make sure we've got a path to fully funding the pension. So, reduced demand, no supply disruptions create a better environment for storage. So we're clearly pursuing the path that would avoid future litigation cost and attempt to settle this sooner rather than later. <strong>Ryan Rosenthal - Sidoti & Company </strong> Good, Wanted to catch up - questions here on the wholesale storage business, specifically if you could discuss the improvement in year-over-year storage operating revenue that the company forecasts for the '09, 2010 winter season. But, obviously, the same thing that impacts transportation margins impacted forward margins. In terms of the - I guess the spending on litigation around Jefferson Island, how do you balance the higher expenses there with the potential upside if you do get that project to go forward? <strong>Douglas N. Schantz</strong> Ryan, I would pay attention again to the split between our salt and reservoir because our salt we can wait on, because you can fill the capacity of salt storage typically in 20 days versus reservoir which has to be spread over, 5, 4 or 5 months so, clearly, we're going to hold back on our salt as we look at the dynamics on the storage box, but the reservoir we have to earlier and spread it out evenly. But we carry; we have capacity rights to about 28 BCF right now. Reviewing the NYMEX futures curve, it appears that it did improve for the storage curve later in the cycle. Normally for these facilities the best time to contract for that capacity is closer to the in service date and so we have been actively working that right now. And if you could, could you familiarize me with essentially the break down between the reservoir storage and the salt storage in terms of each percentage of your business? And actually we still have a couple BCF on top of that, that salt capacity. <strong>Douglas N. Schantz</strong> Ryan, this is Doug Schantz, and obviously the spread did move out as we kind of got into the third quarter and there was kind of some storage box dynamics. But, yes, no doubt the storage spreads are materially above last year at this time and, of course, that's what's behind the $35 million roll out schedule. But we always would use our options related to litigation if we can't settle this in a way that allows us to get that project back on track."

Drew will describe the components in more detail. There are number of other provisions in the case as detailed in our press release last week, and we are certainly happy to answer any questions you may have regarding those We expect the final written order to be issued by the end of this month. The Commission also recognized the need to provide nearly $10 million of recovery for some of the customer first initiatives that will improve customer service levels and funding to increase the number of service technicians available to reduce response times for establishing service and fulfilling other customer orders. During this year’s third quarter, the increase in the hedge gains was offset by $5 million of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments resulting from declining NYMEX prices. As you probably recall, we entered this year with nearly $30 million of storage rollout value, which was significantly higher than our average at year end over the past five years. Despite these competitive pressures, SouthStar has maintained very stable market share and continues to serve 33% of the Georgia market. This project is currently providing service to our anchor customer under a long-term contract for about one-third of the facilities capacity. Those factors have constrained the economic value generation from our existing natural gas inventory and transportation portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, we had $6 million embedded in the storage rollout scheduled over the next three quarters, including $1 million in the fourth quarter this year. Given those external factors we believe the PSC awarded the company sufficient additional funds for our baseline operations and the additional safety and compliance work we must perform over the next year and is therefore a reasonable and constructive outcome. Our distribution business has performed very well year-to-date. On a year-to-date basis, we have recorded $44 million of storage and transportation hedge gains as compared to a net $42 million during the prior year period. We will continue to dewater the cavern to the end of the year in preparation for full commercial operations to begin next spring at the beginning of the annual storage injection cycle. These gains are very similar year-over-year but from different sources, transportation last year and storage activity this year. In the meantime, we will continue to leach the second cavern at GTS, that’s going very well and we remain on track to have that cavern in commercial operations in early 2012. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections, and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. We have seen an $8 million improvement in year-over-year commercial activity and operating expenses in this business have declined $7 million year-over-year, mainly as a result of a lower incentive compensation costs. I’ll briefly describe the components of the $27 million increase and Hank Linginfelter and Bryan Batson also are here to address any specific questions you might have about the case. Placing GTS in service was a significant accomplishment for our Pivotal Storage Group as well as many others throughout the company who have worked hard over the past couple of years to construct this important facility. As we noted in our earnings release, Sequent continues to be challenged by an environment of lower volatility as we’ve seen robust supply and diminished transportation value in the market. Turning to the unregulated part of our business, we also reached the major milestone in our storage business during the third quarter, as we put the Golden Triangle Storage facility into initial commercial operation in mid September. The Commission authorized a 51% equity component in the capital structure as compared to the previous 48%. These improved margins were offset somewhat by a decrease in average number of customers and pricing plan mix and lower optimization revenues. In the prior year quarter, we recorded a net $9 million gain in storage and transportation hedges, a $21 million year-over-year difference. The first component is the base revenue requirement, which represents about $11 million of the total. Our revised filing had requested $14 million for the base revenue component. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10- Q and are further detailed in our latest Form 10-K filing. The increase is principally due to the addition of earnings from the pipeline projects we put in service last year, Hampton Roads Crossing in Virginia and Magnolia project in Georgia.","The interesting thing is as we speak and as we get into this current market dynamic where we’ve now reached a market where storage is as full as we’ve seen in history, we are starting to see opportunities of spreads widening and opportunities now coming to the market. So we’re in the process now going out for an open season. Drew Evans It’s also fair to say that lower gas prices have a benefit to this business unit as well, which is we’re building inventory that’s pretty consistent with what we’ve built in previous years that we are building at $3.5 to $4 as opposed to the $8 or $9 environment that we’re in two years ago. What we presented in the case around NUI, when you look at the way AGL services are set up, there was a reduction in allocations of roughly $16 million, and our case was positioned upon us being able to retain 50% of that or roughly $8.0 million. But as far as the scale and size of the business and the support systems and the employees involved, we don’t see a material change in either direction on that. As we have seen recently we will probably set a new record for the amount of gas in storage before we enter into the winter and start going into the withdrawal mode. John Somerhalder Clearly with the pressure we see today, I mean Pete’s talked about a couple opportunities and we have mentioned in a number of things and one being with the fullest storage and we have seen this several times in the past when we get to the spring, people are going to look for opportunities, put gas in the ground for the coming winter, the storage box type. As you know producers are picking up, significant amounts of the new transportation capacity that are being built in the shale’s and they don’t have the scale or the systems or the capabilities necessarily as some of the small and mid- sized producer shops to extract the value out of those assets. As an example, this summer when the power generation was running we still were providing services just with our lower margins. It certainly is a very constructive policy at the Georgia level and gives us a lot of certainty as we pro forma these things, but we have to be realistic which is any acquisition we do has to be accretive to shareholder value in the very short-term. So we do see the opportunity in the future with the power generation that’s come on line, continues to come on line when the markets are more balanced, we still see not only that we’ll have the opportunity to provide those services, but at the same time, we’ll see potentially improved margins once the market is more balanced. John Somerhalder Carl, I think it is important to point out and I think you’ve stated it correctly that the type of transactions we’re doing we’re moving that focus, but it’s consistent with what we talked about earlier producer services, providing gas for power plants, but it has shifted our focus slightly. So the plan now is to continue to expand those facilities through leaching and then as we see we’re right to make decisions about Greenfield, our new facilities or adding compressions and headers, some of the other expensive equipment, but the base expansions are fairly expensive and that’s what our plan is at this time. In that environment it’s not even as much the absolute commodity price, but in that environment, where there is a lot of gas available, we have seen less volatility even though we see still good opportunities. Longer-term with the amount of power generation that’s going in with the load factors we’ve seen on power generation, longer term we see that we’ll have the opportunity to sell that at a fair rate and what our plans generally are with our business even though we have options or have an option for Greenfield facility, what the plans are at this point would be to continue to expand facilities where we have leach facilities and surface compressions and headers. As Pete describe transportation is changing significantly with the change in flow of gas and that provides some pretty decent opportunity for us as well. With the first full year commercial operation after acquisition expenses are taken very different accounting environment than when we did this in 2004, but we also have to be realistic about our industry, there have been maybe 12 or 15 transactions in the last half dozen years that relate to gas utility and we have seen a lot of increased activity around the electrics, but principally in independent power production space as opposed to regulated utilities. Pete Tumminello Carl, let me let me answer it this way, over the last couple of years what you’ve seen is Sequent growing in the fee and service-based side of our business where we’ve increased the amount of fuel supply to power generators and increase the amount of services we provided to producers. Synergies were certainly higher in NUI, because of the problems that that company found itself in and I think our reductions were close to 50% in non-fuel O&M. How do we change to reflect that new normal, say for instance as contracts roll off we are obviously signing on to new capacity agreements and we are getting better rates for that right now. There is a lower level of volatility both in packing the storage and transportation market. The activity is probably in the same range we’ve seen, it’s just that we are taking on transactions at a bit lower fixed rates and we’re just having the commercial discipline around how we approach and how we pay for those transactions, but it really hasn’t reduced, the level of activity the volume or the size in terms of the amount of transport and storage that we plan to hold over the next say, short term year to two years. At the same time production is at unprecedented levels, the development of the shale and people drilling to hold on to leases and those types of things. So that’s I think fair, but I also think this market could respond a little differently too, potential upside to that given the storage box that the market’s finding itself in now. A couple of quick questions, I guess on Ted’s question on contracting opportunities for storage. Are you sourcing this businesses or now in a new normal where gas prices are lower and more range bound or do you think is the forward curve wrong, are you seeing opportunities out there, where you say well it looks like that this volatility is going to pick up and maybe how is that translating into, how far out on the curve you’re going with taking on the contracts and trades and things like that? As we’re de-watering, because we are part of the cavern de-water, we can provide service for that first anchor customer, and we’re heading towards this spring being able to provide service for the remaining roughly 4 Bcf of capacity, but you’re right, at this particular time as well as the facilities performing with the lack of volatility, the rates are under pressure. John Somerhalder Ted, I mean clearly I think everyone in the business sees that we have had a combination of very high storage levels. Ted Durbin Goldman Sachs And then just slipping that around and thinking about actually on the asset side, your ownership of Golden Triangle and storage, but I mean how does that make you think about, where contracting rates are going to come in for storage, and even thoughts about expanding storage putting capital dollars to work to build new storage? I’m trying to figure out, how much really could be ring fenced to the benefit of the Georgia customer versus these other jurisdictions where clearly there was tremendous opportunity to bring efficiency to. So I think it does give us a better platform to look at those types of activities and as you all know, we’ve looked at that on a regular basis. So, we brought significant level of services to the producer community to help bring their gas to market and to bring our acumen on the transport grid to them in terms of either shareable or fixed types arrangements for producers. What were the total NUI savings, because I’m assuming whether it was Elizabethtown or Florida or wherever there were savings kind of across the field, and I guess what I’m ultimately trying to get at is let’s say you guys go off and do something in Missouri for instance, you’d make a bit of a step out. However, we are still entering new transportation storage and asset management agreements a normal course of business. It has not lowered the amount of activity."

We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures, such as operating margins, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Sequent and others relying on this historical secondary flow were unable to transport Marcellus gas to market and were forced to either secure higher price transportation capacity or sell out volumes at lower market prices. But we’ve extended leaching period, and we think we’ll be a little closer to 7 Bcf by the time we begin commercial operation. Moving onto Slide 9, you can see that our energy investments segment had slight improvement during the quarter as compared to last year. Such large increases in production, coupled with a growing supply of storage capacity, have also had a negative impact on storage optimization values. At this point, we expect to be well ahead of our 2011 EBIT guidance of $374 million for the distribution segment by the time we close out the year. As a result of this disparity between the Texas region and the northeast, natural gas prices in the producing regions in the Gulf and mid-continent increased, while prices in the midwest and northeast decreased, resulting in a negative impact on pipeline transportation values. Assuming that we stay in this low volatility environment for 2012, we may be looking at EBIT for the wholesale segment that is half or potentially a little less than half of our original EBIT projection of $53 million for the business in 2011. SouthStar is on track for another good year, and we continue to make progress on our storage assets. Importantly, we now have balanced our position with transportation capacity that came online November 1st and expect the impact to further diminish in magnitude going forward. In securing this forward gas supply, Sequent was relying on historical pipeline operations that would allow such gas supply purchases to flow on a secondary basis on the pipeline. We also recognized losses of $15 million related to transportation constraints in the Marcellus Shale region. Transportation spreads between the Gulf Coast and northeast essentially collapsed for much of the summer, significantly hampering our ability to earn margins on gas transportation. Operating margin was lower by $47 million largely driven by the same issues affecting the third quarter with $30 million of the decrease coming from lower hedge gains, higher LOCOM and the remainder due to a transportation constraint in customer credit losses. Looking to our current storage rollout schedule at the end of the third quarter, Sequent has $6 million of economic value, which is equivalent to last year at the same time. Looking at other factors aside from commercial activity that impacted us during the quarter. Shifting now to the Marcellus constraint issue that we experienced during the third quarter, over the last 2 years, Sequent executed forward purchases of gas supply in the Marcellus. Year-to-date, our distribution business reported EBIT of $287 million, up 10% versus last year. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. This fundamental weakening of transportation and storage asset values in the third quarter has been caused by 2 major factors: third quarter weather dynamics and continued increases in natural gas production. And similar to our distribution business, Mike and his team have effectively controlled their costs. Excess gas supply in this region caused severe compression of the price spread differential from the Gulf Coast to the northeast and significantly eroded third quarter pipeline optimization values. By purchasing gas supply in Pennsylvania and closer to our asset management customer, city gates, our view is that Sequent would save money on transportation charges as it is less expensive to transport gas supply from Pennsylvania to the customers than from Texas and Louisiana to those customers. And by September, the vast majority of secondary flow was curtailed. However we continue to see strong performance in our utility business resulting from a combination of reasonable rate case outcomes and infrastructure investments we’ve made to maintain and enhance the safety and reliability of our system. The decline in year-over-year earnings is largely reflective of a significant negative variance in our wholesale services segment related to lower natural gas price spreads, lower volatility of takeaway capacity constraints in the Marcellus shale production region. On the right, note that our distribution business continues to be the largest operating segment contributor to EBIT representing approximately 81% of the total positive EBIT contributions in the first 9 months of 2011. They’ve done a good job managing that business in a very competitive Georgia environment and successfully maintaining a leading market share position. Before we conclude today’s call, I want to give you a quick update on the Nicor merger approval process, which is outlined on Slide 13. The only rate case activity on our agenda currently is for Virginia Natural Gas. $18 million of the year-over- year decline was related to general poor wholesale market conditions, including low price volatility for natural gas and tight transportation storage spread. Our rate cases last year and ongoing infrastructure investment programs are providing support, and we have maintained our track record of controlling costs in that business. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Starting with third quarter weather, you can see on Slide 11 that while there was warmer than usual weather in parts of the country in July and August, the primary areas served by Sequent, the northeast and the midwest experienced cooler temperatures and reduced gas-fired power supply relative to 2010. Unlike weather which is transitory, we continue to see significant increases in shale gas production. At the end of September, we received a proposed order from the administrative law judge hearing the case in Illinois. In our storage business, we are still reaching Cavern 2 at Golden Triangle and expect that, that facility will come on line late in the first quarter of 2012. In most geographic locations in the U.S., the wholesale natural gas industry and Sequent are experiencing continued declining values for pipeline transportation and storage. Sequent has about 30 Bcf of storage that is impacted by the change in price spreads over the summer to winter seasons. Due to reduced transportation and gas cost, we experienced increased margins, but that was partially offset by the continued competitive environment in Georgia, including lower retail price spreads. Retail accounted for 18%, energy investments for 1%. The largest component of EBIT decline came from a $35 million reduction in commercial activity versus last year, giving you a breakdown of commercial activity during the quarter. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, during the third quarter of 2010, we had unusually large storage and transportation hedge gains of $30 million. As a result of this issue, Sequent experienced losses of $15 million during the third quarter, and that includes $7 million associated with renegotiation -- we’re renegotiating certain of its producer agreements. The improvement was due to increased revenue at Golden Triangle Storage, which we put into commercial operation in the third quarter of last year. Shale production increases are focused in the northeast market areas, particularly in the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania. Wrapping up our prepared remarks today, though we experienced challenges in our wholesales services business during the third quarter, our distribution business performed particularly well. As expected, Sequent continues to face the challenges in lower market volatility and lower price differentials for storage and transportation. Moving on to our distribution segment. I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 6. U.S. total gas production grew to over 63 billion cubic foot per day in the third quarter with production increasing by almost 5 Bcf per day in the past year, much of this due to the shale gas. These volumes flowed reliably using secondary transportation service until late July at which time Sequent started experiencing curtailments of a portion of secondary transportation due to extreme supply growth in the region. Operating expenses in the distribution segment decreased by 2% driven mainly by lower incentive compensation accruals. We initially planned for the facility to have 6 Bcf of working gas capacity.","And we expect that we'll be able to largely cover the cost of that transportation moving forward, but that is the remaining issue that we face. That was the largest piece of the 15, but 7 of the 15 was really rebalancing our portfolio, so we did not have a mismatch between our obligations to take gas and our ability to transport the gas out on a firm basis. Further, we entered into pipeline transformation that went online November 1, which helps to balance our position. So we're now not in a position where we need to settle and rebalance this, and we’re in a position where we have the pipeline transportation to move gas out. Not as much, I think it's much smaller than yours, but that's also suffering from storage-spread issues. So that gives us opportunity moving forward with the firm capacity. Mark Barnett Morningstar Inc., Research Division Okay, I guess one more question on the infrastructure side, on the energy investment side, I should say. But it’s a material factor in the way that, that business operates, in some regard, but it’s not unanticipated. So that capacity that we had started to get curtailed that we made sure that we have capacity that we can use on a primary, in the past, firm basis to get out of this point where we were seeing these rapid increases in supply. So it is possible that when we get those permits next year that the environment will say, it’s time to immediately move to construction and it’s very possible as well that we’ll say we want to wait and evaluate the market for this. So basically what happened was you guys were buying on the spot transport market and didn’t -- and when the volume spiked, you didn't have capacity to transport your volumes. Andrew Evans As we’ve kind of walked through over the last several years, it has been a slow process for us to achieve permitting at both Cavern 3 and 4 Jefferson Island. So the challenge we face moving forward, and it’s much diminished from what we’ve faced in this time period even in the October time period, is that we have pipeline transportation firm capacity with a cost that we'll need to move these volumes and capture margin on that. I think that the issue that we’re dealing with is given the situation I laid out in the prepared text with the fact that new capacities come online and so much shale gas and other gas is available, we’ve seen low enough spreads and values for storage that we’re going to be disciplined. With the dish [ph] permitting, it’s fairly normal to have some kind of delays I suppose, but are you now projecting any kind of delay in your expected and start construction there? But now you have firm capacity going forward? Andrew Evans I mean I think if you look at the projections for the 2 businesses, a lot of - any discomfort we have is probably associated with the businesses that we currently own today. What we were doing, we had capacity, firm capacity in the region, but we were using it on a secondary basis out of the path, which meant that you had priority rights, but not as higher rights as primary firm. Sarah M. Stashak Director of Investor Relations What we do see is that on the distribution businesses, very good results out of our distribution businesses, very good results out of Nicor’s distribution businesses as I think you’ve seen from their release. So we’re still optimistic about it, but at this point we’re going to be very disciplined about that. But when you look at the other states we do business, the other products even on the commodity side it’s a reasonably small part of that business and therefore we still feel good about our ability to maintain earnings and have the chance to grow earnings in that business. But at this time even though that process has moved slowly, it’s also moved in a positive direction."

We are trending favorably to expectation year-to-date by approximately $5 million due to the timing of some long-term financing activity and higher capitalized interest related to the timing of placing our storage assets into commercial service this year. You can see our historical storage rollout schedule. On Slide 5, you can see that more than 80% of our consolidated positive operating EBIT for the first 9 months of 2012 was generated by our distribution operations segment. The economic value of the storage rollout schedule is $65 million as of the end of the quarter, well above the $6 million storage rollout value at this time last year, and also well above the historical average storage rollout value at the end of the third quarter. The primary reason for the decline is the impact of the unprecedented warmer than normal weather in the first half of the year as well as mark-to-market storage hedge losses. Briefly, the cargo shipping segment reported an EBIT loss of $1 million during the third quarter of 2012. But it’s important to keep in mind that Sequent has generated higher economic value during the quarter and throughout the year. However, we recorded storage hedge losses of $15 million due to rising natural gas prices. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-Q, and more fully described in our most recent 10-K filings. Retail operations accounted for 17% year-to-date and midstream operations, 1%. Importantly, we remain focused on managing controllable expenses and we have made significant progress towards achieving our efficiency initiatives related to the Nicor merger. We also recorded a lower cost of market adjustment for LOCOM of $9 million during the third quarter of 2011, and storage hedge gains of $14 million. You can see the blended rates for each storage facility on the chart at the bottom right side of the page. Second, Pete and the Sequent team have done an excellent job of creating economic value around our storage positions but this economic value largely remains in our storage rollout schedule and therefore has not yet shown up in our reported results in the wholesale segment. Wholesale Services and cargo shipping are not represented here, as they reported EBIT losses through the first 9 months. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. We are earning close to our allowed rates of return at each utility and we have managed our non-regulated businesses in a way that optimizes their value despite challenging market fundamentals. Forward-looking statements involve matters that are not historical facts and our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from our actual results. We now expect our spending to be down about $30 million relative to our earlier projections. Revenue per unit is down but shipments are up, relative to the same period last year. You will recall that in the last year’s third quarter we recorded margin losses of $17 million due to transportation constraints in the Marcellus region as well as the impact of a credit default due to a customer bankruptcy. Overall, the market for storage remains weak but we continue to focus on ways to optimize the value of our available capacity while not committing the long-term contracts in this low price environment. And based on the current projection of year end storage positions of 33 BCF, a $1 increase in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in the $31 million reduction to wholesale services’ reported operating revenues for 2012, but would increase the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013 by a corresponding amount. As a result we have a storage rollout scheduled of $65 million and we expect to realize that value in operating revenue during the remainder of 2012 and into 2013. The increase mainly reflects the addition of Nicor's retail businesses to our portfolio as well as a reduction in transportation and gas cost and lower bad debt expense at Southstar relative to last year.","We have resources we can bring from our Illinois operations and more from the others. We have been following the New Jersey natural filing and this morning with us is Scott Carter who is recently elevated to head of our regulatory and commercial operations. But we’ve got -- at this point we think we got it under control. They probably wouldn’t be material to Elizabethtown’s or AGL’s operations, but if they are significant we would have to seek some sort of regulatory treatment from the BPU. With the 1% to 2% flooding that will require some serious work on our part but we think we have got that all assessed and we feel pretty good about our ability to get customers back on as soon as they are in their homes without flooding and that their equipment is in good shape and it’s been inspected. So we feel about as good as we could, given the devastation about things and it will be a modest impact on our operations there. Our field forces have taken care of all emergency orders of blowing gas from ruptured pipelines, from trees falling and so forth. Of course the power outage you can still use the gas water heaters, so people are taking hot showers and you can cook, but you can't use your central furnace. That certainly makes things a little bit easier to get through the regulatory process. I think that we have to, to some degree, although with a flat yield curve hedging of issuances actually relatively inexpensive these days. Of course a large percentage is without power still. We’ll still have a heavier workload as we move forward and as Hank talked about, as there is something in the range of 3,000 of our customers impacted by floods or high waters which we need to get in there and help them. But we will watch and see how that plays out, and then ultimately how that will affect the process we have on the table. So we will focus very heavily on restoring service to anyone who is out once power comes back on for their heating, if there is any work for us to do. And the flooding is the big issue going forward and the power outage."

Excluding this factor, our expense control has been excellent this year, which is consistent with our shared services model. As a result, we have entered into shorter-term contracts at lower rates, reflective of the current market, and in some cases have further optimized the value of the assets through short-duration transactions. And I'll just remind you that mark-to-market accounting related to storage and transportation hedge movements can have a meaningful impact on our wholesale business and our consolidated results. Briefly, you can see the results for the cargo shipping segment on Slide 9. Through September, EBIT at the wholesale segment has improved by $37 million year-over-year, primarily driven by commercial activity that is $62 million, offset by net hedge losses in 2013 versus net hedge gains in 2012 and the $11 million gain on the sale of Compass in the second quarter of 2013. Importantly, underlying all of this is, is our ongoing focus on controlling expenses, which has resulted in additional favorability to our initial forecast. And our cargo shipping business volumes have improved meaningfully year-over-year due to improving market fundamentals and a highly focused management team. The storage rollout schedule at the end of September was $23 million, compared to $65 million at the end of the same period in 2012. In our distribution business, our infrastructure investment programs have resulted in enhanced safety and pipeline integrity for our customers while generating additional revenues for our shareholders. The $21 million improvement is driven by strong commercial activity, offset by net hedge losses. The principal variance in the quarter relates to strong commercial activity in our wholesale services segment despite being muted by hedge losses. Excluding wholesale services, EPS was $0.24 for the quarter, compared to $0.21 last year, due to year- over-year improvements at distribution operations, retail operations and cargo shipping. The midstream segment decline year-over-year is due largely to the roll off of legacy contracts that were above current market rates, as well as higher depreciation, property tax and other storage-related expenses due to the additional facilities in service when compared to last year. We made some targeted acquisitions in our retail business earlier this year, both of which are already generating enhanced returns. Slightly-colder- than-normal weather across our distribution and retail businesses through June resulted in favorability to expectations of $0.05. The $42 million year-over-year reduction is reflective of the monetization of many of our storage positions as we withdrew natural gas from storage in the first half of this year. Turning to Georgia and New Jersey on Slide 13, in Georgia, we received approval of our request to replace approximately 750 miles of vintage plastic pipeline over a 4-year period. In our wholesale services business, we scaled back our cost structure to withstand a low-volatility environment and our team in Houston has done a remarkable job of retaining customers, bringing in new business and positioning our storage and transportation portfolios to take advantage of market dislocations that are occurring as a result of a shale gas revolution. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and more fully described in today's 10-Q filing. In addition, our non-payroll expense discipline is among the best in our sector due to our shared services model and our ability to generate efficiencies while spreading costs over a larger customer base. Through the first 9 months, our distribution segment contributed 78% of operating EBIT and our retail businesses contributed 17%. Forward-looking statements involve matters that are not historical facts, and our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from our actual results. As a continuation of our STRIDE program, we filed a new $260 million program in August that would be applied to system reinforcement and customer growth projects, carrying our schedule in November with the ruling anticipated in December of 2013. A related rule making it is now before the ICC, and we are actively involved in that process. The variance year-over-year through September is mainly due to: colder weather and usage compared to the same periods that were historically warm last year in distribution and retail; higher revenues from regulatory infrastructure programs; higher commercial activity in the wholesale services segment; and the gain on the sale of Compass, offset by higher compensation expense accruals related to above-target performance for the full year. Taking a closer look at each segment, a snapshot of third quarter EBIT for our distribution business is on Slide 5. The substantial improvement in commercial activity is related to improved monetization of our diverse asset portfolio.","I think we do see the next couple of years to be a continued challenge with the overhang of the supply and the abilities from gas-fired power generators to go back and forth between gas and coal, and in effect, have some surrogacy for storage. We've always seen in the past that weather events materially different than normal, on either side, have resulted in some dislocation and potential value in that market. We do see, as John mentioned, longer- term, some recovery in those rates as those volatilities should increase with LNG exports and new loads, industrial and power-gen loads, increasing. We do believe that the legislation that Governor Quinn signed this year fits our needs very well, even though we will not be able to start putting new programs in place and having a surcharge before early 2015, that works very well with our planning cycle. Our view is if you look several years out and you look at what's going on related to industrial demand growth and exports to Mexico and then LNG exports, there are drivers in those time periods. In the near term, we see very few drivers for changes in the storage rates other than what you mentioned. Mark Barnett Morningstar Inc., Research Division Two quick questions, so I think you briefly touched on new Illinois filing mechanism here, but have you looked at the potential for filing under the Senate Bill 9 process for particular types of grid investments?"

SouthStar's retail margins also increased through a combination of retail price spreads and contributions from its commercial operations function which optimizes storage and transportation assets... its storage and transportation assets. We received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on December 31, to move ahead with this project, and we accepted the certificate in January. I think this just illustrates the fact that we have a good portfolio of businesses on which we generate stable returns over the long term that portfolio has a large measure of productivity built into it as more of 90% of our consolidated earnings before interest and taxes in 2007 was from regulated operations and assets that have stable reoccurring revenue streams associated with them. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements and you should refer to the additional information contained in the Form 10-K we filed this morning as well as our SEC filings concerning factors that could cause those material differences. Coupling both margin and expense we saw $28 million improvement in earnings before interest and taxes for the distribution business. We signed an agreement with Southern Natural Gas to obtain an undivided interest in pipelines connecting our system to Elba and we have filed for FERC approval of the project which we anticipate will achieve that some time in 2008. The open season for storage services we held in 2007 illustrates the strong demand for this project and we will keep you up-to-date on our progress as we head into the construction phase. These decreases were offset by a $20 million reduction in lower cost of market adjustments and our inventory for 2007 net of hedging recoveries in 2006 and 2007. That has been the case for the past two years with the more normal Sequent in 2007 which follow two years of higher earnings in that segment as well as the additional commitment of development dollars for our growth projects. We now are securing some of the other necessary state and local approvals, and we expect that we will began construction in April or May timeframe of this year. The main drivers are that we had a $36 million reduction hedge gains on storage and transportations in 2007 as compared to the prior year and we had a $46 million reduction in commercial activity. Clearly we believe the fundamental value of storage, and the role it will play over the next decade in the linear [ph] energy demands are strong. I think it is important to keep in mind that we manage the business with a long term view and consistent with that there may be times when the earnings growth may not exactly be even distributed from one year to the next. We also strengthened our ability to better serve commercial and industrial customers through the acquisition of Compass Energy which provides a platform for us to build our capabilities in that segment of the market. We also announced that as part of the Georgia Public Service Commission's approval of the capacity supply plan last year, we will diversify our supply source in Georgia and that will be by gaining additional access to LNG from Elba Island. As a result we are very pleased with the operation of all of our business segments relative to the prior year and relative to our plan. And as we talked about earlier in Florida we received approval from the Florida Commission in December to include the amortization of certain components of the purchase price we paid for Florida City gas and our returns on equity calculations for regulatory reporting purposes and that approval also included provisions for a five-year rates. We continue to strengthen the fundamentals of our utility business during the year and that focus resulted in our distribution business having a good year relative to 2006. We also have began work on our Hampton Roads Crossing project in Virginia which will connect the north and south sections of our service territory there and enhance our to natural gas supply for that region. In the energy investment segment, our existing storage facility Jefferson Island had a very successful year. Operating expenses were down $1 million because of lower development costs associated with our SouthStar storage projects for the year. Its important for us to maintain our long term focus on the business and annual earnings gives us... Operating expenses were down $14 million in distribution operations mainly due to lower incentive compensation related to earnings results below our internal expectation. The reduction in commercial activity was driven by reduced storage spreads and lower volatility in the marketplace. Our distribution operations business continues to perform well in the challenging environment with a $30 million increase in operating margin. About $2 million of the increase was from higher pipeline replacement revenue in Georgia and another $2 million resulted from higher base rates at Chattanooga Gas following a rate case in 2006. Turning to retail operations, our SouthStar business had a very strong performance for the year with a $32 million increase in operating margin relative to the property the prior year. The first is an ongoing collaborative effort between our utilities and sequent to focus on the renewal of some of our key asset management agreements. First our Texas storage investment Golden Triangle Storage, continues to move forward as planned. Commercial activities measure that we focus on as it excludes accounting adjustments on gas inventories and other hedges related to price change. Interest expenses for the year increased $2 million or about 1.6% and that was due to primarily to the increase in short term interest rates and a $3 million premium that was paid in order to redeem $75 million in trust preferred securities. In addition to generating additional operating margin through optimizing interruptible capacity. This repurchases was enabled only because we reduced capital expenses versus expectation around our storage builds in 2007. We expect that project to be completed on schedule by late 2009. Again taking these back where we saw $20 million improvement in retail energy operations earnings before interest and taxes contribution. The margin increase was due to several factors so I'll breakdown the major components for you. Lets go to energy investments. Normalized earnings level from SouthStar and some additional business development expenses associated with our capital investment and storage projects. During the year, we move forward three capital investment growth projects, that will add significant long term value to our company.","And then in terms of the... and the reconciliation table that you guys provide the gain and loss on storage hedges and the gain and loss on transportation hedges. What was your achieved return... rate of return in Georgia for the full year and may be a little bit more break down on the operating cost reductions and distribution, and what portion of that for example came from the lower compensation versus some of the other factors? And in terms of customer growth you added 21,000 customers to overall distribution operation. Unidentified Analyst Hi, quick question follow up on Golden Triangle, I think you had mentioned where you are in the process, of permitting and then in April-May construction start date. Can you be a little more specific on the local permitting that's left to do may be just a update on costs of the actual project and expectations for how you'll finance it? Its on page 33 and we call the roll out schedule but it shows about $11 million of expected operating revenue from physical inventory withdrawals in 2008. Unidentified Analyst Okay and I am sorry, if I missed this, but I think last quarter you'd mentioned that there was a potential new storage project. In terms of the cost of the project the overall cost I believe we are estimating around 260 to 265. What you are seeing and if you are seeing more infrastructure funds participating in picking up from the natural gas distribution companies? John W. Somerhalder II But if you look at the reduction, O&M for a customer, more than half of that was associated with incentive compensation, and the other major pieces was as Drew indicated, our IT spend and our ability to control costs in that area and some of our customer service costs that resulted from some of the initiatives we have had over the past several years. Andrew W. Evans If you think about the underlying mechanisms I think they work pretty appropriately and we look at the individual segments in their performance, you know distribution operations had fantastic growth year- over-year but we did have some expectations John so that it would be in the 1 to 1.25 range that's going to lead the slightly lower incentive comp. And then usually you guys do a kind of table or an analysis of what the pent up margin is going forward to the rest of the storage season? We started the year with a target of somewhere in the 1.25% growth range for our entire distribution operations and we were actually on track as we came to the middle of the year it looked like we are very much on track to achieve that, because we had done very well on the attrition side in slowing down attrition. John W. Somerhalder II The major timing would be commercially... or operationally having the first cavern and service in the 2010 time period, the second cavern about a year following that, and what happens in between drilling of the wells, Brian disposal wells and leaching out the cavern and that's what takes time between start of construction in April and May and first operations of some caverns. Andrew W. Evans In terms of expenses, relative to our budget we paid incentive compensation it was about $7 million lower in distribution. John W. Somerhalder II We built in some middle position between that higher volatility time period and a return to... in fact we saw low volatility in very, very few months in 2007 where you could generate value. We had a $6 million increase in depreciation expense and that was largely offset by reductions in... lets see if I had the bucket term its mainly information technology, customer service expense was a big component as we get more of a full year run rate on call center operations and pension expense was down. I think that... what they did was add some capacity in Phoenix for one particular customer, it was a quite large build out, what we got with additional capacities which should give us opportunity to build follow on revenue, their goal is just to add continual revenue streams to capacity and more about gifted in the K but in the 20% to 30% range in terms of subscription. John W. Somerhalder II It's pretty straight forward, and that is coming off of two years in wholesale energy marketing a very high volatility when we put together those targets without getting too precise. Andrew W. Evans One of the things that John mentioned was that we will take a little bit of a pause as we spend a bit more on development in the storage business that's the reason we're making those investments is because we view that they increase the long-term growth rate of the business. Unidentified Analyst And then in terms of financing the project yourself?"

We have completed construction or nearing completion of construction on a number of facilities and those include four brine disposal wells, the brine line, the leeching facilities and drilling of salt at our cavern well number one. And the simple answer is that, when we formed the holding company AGL Resources back in 1996, the ticker symbol AGL was already taken, so we went with ATG. We pay close attention to maturity -- or to the maturing of our assets and liabilities and we have no significant maturities in 2009 and we expect to build summer inventories that cost significantly lower than last year. We could make additional contributions in 2009 up to $61 million for a total of up to $68 million in order to preserve the current level of benefits under the plans in accordance with the funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act. The second factor is that we recognized the $35 million increase in storage and transportation hedge gains and the third factor is the negative impact of $15 increase of net low comp adjustments; all these reconciliation items are listed in our 10-K on page 34. Jefferson Island operating margin was $3 million higher year-over-year, but operating expenses and legal work around the expansion of the Jefferson Island project absorbed that gain. Adjusting for those expenses, distribution operations would have been essentially flat year-over-year. As John pointed out, adjusting for those expenses, the distribution segment was relatively flat year-over-year. Also, in our energy investments segment we continue to make significant progress on our Golden Triangle Storage project in Texas. The 2008 reported results for SouthStar were somewhat perturbed by lower cost or market inventory valuation adjustments in the latter half of the year. The first is that, Sequent had a $25 million year-over-year increase in commercial activity from $61 million in 2007 to $86 million in 2008. Overall, I would say, our utility business performed admirably during the first -- during one of the historical worst residential housing markets with the focus on reducing controllable expense. In the distribution segment, EBIT was down $9 million in 2008 relative to 2007 or less than a 3% decline. Operating margin of $818 was down by only $2 million, primarily the result of lower customer usage offset partially by higher pipeline replacement revenues at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown Gas and some modest customer growth year-over-year. Some examples of that success include our recent successful outcomes in rate cases in Tennessee and Maryland; the approvals we received in Florida for amortization of the acquisition premium; the approvals we have received in Virginia for conservation and de-coupling programs, as well as for the collection of AFUDC for the Hampton Roads Crossing pipeline project. We are in the process now of commissioning those facilities and we will be able to start leeching that number one cavern well here over the next several weeks. Before we move to the prepared remarks, let me remind you that our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We did see that moderation during the year, and we also saw a slight decline in market share in Georgia, and also recorded a significant inventory valuation adjustment, which Drew will discuss in a few minutes. So the construction process for GTS is going very well and we are on track to meet our initial commercial operations target. So, you can see the effects of our cost control containment in the segment. The Hampton Roads Crossing project or pipeline replacement program and the Magnolia project are all examples of the prudent investments we have made in the business to improve the quality, reliability and overall value of the services we provide to our customers. The most significant component of the increase was related to the method by which we compensate employees in that segment, which is based on a percentage of EBIT, but headcount related to our base business and expansion into more commercial and industrial marketing activities also played a role. The increase resulted from higher market volatility related to late summer, tropical storm activity in the Golf Coast region and colder weather in the fourth quarter. The various factors that could cause such a material difference are included in our press release and are more fully described in our 10-K filing. Commercial activity is generally a good way to gauge economic value created and recognized during a given period. SouthStar has done an excellent job of managing bad debt expense and maintains the credit quality of its customer portfolio; no small task in the current environment. The structure afforded us the opportunity to manage -- to effectively manage our cost structure and to find organic ways to grow our business in order to avoid seeking rate relief through the regulatory process. On the table -- the table on page 78 of the 10-K provides more detail on our credit facility and outstanding borrowings and you can see that we currently have $773 million outstanding relative to our $1.1 billion in total capacity. Our energy investments segment also had strong performance for the year and part of the increase reflects the fact that AGL Networks successfully constructed a network asset for a key customer. In addition, the economic conditions have resulted in much more consumer price shopping then we have seen in the past and more customers shipping to fixed-price plans rather than floating on a variable plan. It also assumes a return to a more normal earning level for Sequent, down from the $60 million to around $45 million; a base level year for SouthStar and that would be in the range of about $95 million or our share about $70 million; and it takes into account increased expensing of some development and maintenance costs related to our storage projects at GTS and then maintenance at our Jefferson Island facility. We maintain sizable buffers in that facility, over and above our working capital requirements even during peak injection periods, and we have had no significant exposure to banks that collapsed in 2008. We have a history of working cooperatively and in a constructive manner with regulators and we operate in states where the regulatory commissions have shown a willingness to provide appropriate rate relief to other utilities operating in those states. Now that we are past our peak working capital needs and we are in the cash collection cycle, as customers pay their [rental] bills, you will see the outstanding borrowings reduced significantly over the next few months. I will walk you through those bearings in a minute, but let us start with distribution operations. Turning to energy, the energy investments segment, AGL Networks had a strong year in terms of generating a new business and largely drove the EBIT increase of $4 million year-over-year for the segment. As we point out in our disclosures and as John discussed, clearly the hedge gains at Sequent had a positive effect on earnings for the year, but these were offset by lower-of-cost-or-market or LOCOM inventory adjustments made for both Sequent and SouthStar, as a result of declining natural gas prices. What these dynamics have meant for SouthStar is that we have seen market share decline year-over-year in the one percentage point range, although we still maintain our leading market share with 34% of the total market. We expect SouthStar to continue to grow in markets outside of Georgia in 2009 and to continue its focus on maintaining its market share in the increasingly competitive Georgia retail market. The hedge gains on transportation and storage positions also contributed to the reported results for the year. EBIT for the distribution segment was down 3% relative to the prior year, but that was largely driven by higher expenses for incentive compensation, as we met our corporate performance targets for the year. As a result, prudent recovery of this cost to successful rate case outcomes will be an important component of ensuring that rates remain sufficient to recover the capital deployed in our utility business. This is a function of the higher gas prices and inventory builds last summer; we have seen better access to the commercial paper markets recently. Our distribution business faced several challenges through out the year, as a result of the economic downturn, including a slowdown in customer growth and an increase in bad debt expense relative to the prior year. Sequent finished the year with stronger than expected results, in part because of much stronger commercial activity in the business particularly during the fourth quarter.","But I was wondering if you guys could provide a little bit of color on what kind of an increase, on a year-over-year basis or decrease you would have as a result of those non-operating activities? And that would allow us to invest in infrastructure in New Jersey that would help our customers get higher reliability to service, do some things like pipeline replacement and have a good financial result for the company as well. And now we essentially have majority of the surface facilities related to the leeching done; that is everything from the brine line, the brine disposal wells, the pumps of all of the tanks; all of that needed and we are in the process now of completing the water line. Could you go through and try to normalize for the gains and losses, these hedging activities, the low comps, things like that? And we would expect build inventories at the given say, its forward script at a much lower rate. But certainly that as -- as we file in Georgia late this year there is going to be a big component that's pension expense, I would imagine. Could you give us a little more detail on commercial activities specifically in the fourth quarter? Absolutely it will be material. John Somerhalder I think the other piece of that is that New Jersey, in particular, has already approved decoupling, this is [for south] Jersey and for NJR and they have generally maintained their ROEs at traditional levels. Andrew Evans Rate making generally tries to smooth these expenses overtime, so that they don't impact any one customer group and any particular time period and so that's -- it's more logical for them to focus on expense. That was because our weighted average cost of gas and inventory approaches $10, because of high prices from last summer. GAAP is a really good representation of our earnings power for the business for this particular year. Lastly, you noted last quarter and you talked about this, but last quarter commercial activities, were up $16 million at wholesale. We just want to make sure we maintain a reasonable buffer of liquidity but that was done in the -- I think in a decent historical timeframe. Gordon Howald Calyon 18 in the fourth quarter from positive activities. You can see from the cash flow statement in the 10-K that we had I would say $150 million, $170 million net year-over-year build. John Somerhalder The status at this point as we have discussed -- we are pursuing litigation with the State of Louisiana, we think; we have very good rates there and we think that litigation is going well, and our plan is to get that project back on track through litigation or settlement, if possible, and we are looking at both of those alternatives right now. And then lastly, Drew, were you guys seeing any net recouping of working capital year-over-year or just looking at gas prices going into storage this year versus last year? If you think about this rate, Carl we've got 90 bcf billion cubic feet of storage that we built and we built at an average price that approached $10 last year; that's consistent with inventories that were in the $900 million range. The other principal component and I should say, by the way, that schedule represents the zero roll out related to storage. We think that might look a lot more like a tracker for that capital deployed, that would be more real time recovery like our Georgia pipeline replacement program represents. We have a 364 day facility that we used as a supplement in 2008 because of higher gas prices and we'll just take a look at inventory fill and price determining, whether we need to roll that. So obviously, moving to the brining operation of cavern well one will be the next important step, but we are very confident. In terms of looking at the fourth quarter results, we saw our commercial activity year-over-year plus 18, so I am trying to think how that relates to our third quarter results that we disclosed, but you are correct. And, if so, is that material at all? So part of slight decline in net customer count, but it's not material. Andrew Evans The vast majority of our pension expense does relate to utility distribution operations. Andrew Evans We are not planning them. We also have a number -- or saw an increase in other economic activity related to transportation and parking loans and we don't have roll out schedules for those particular items and didn't feel like making the adjustment, [gave] a really good feel for earnings in their entirety."

And that has cleared the way for us to restart the permitting process in order to get the expansion back on track. Other factors driving high operating margins were pipeline replacement revenues, which were up $6 million relative to last year as result of increased investments. Commercial activity really took a hit in 2009. And since inventory levels and costs have been higher this year, our margins from that activity are higher than last year. If you recall when we store gas in our system on behalf of the marketers in Georgia, we collect carrying charges on that inventory. Before Drew discusses our business units' results, I would like to highlight a few of the recent successes we have had from an operational and from a regulatory standpoint. As soon as we start that process we move to leaching out Cavern 2 there and what that allows us to do is head towards a schedule of putting Cavern 2 in service early in 2012. The result there is that we now have an additional 84,000 dekatherms per day of capacity available to serve our customers. So at least what we are seeing today is a strengthening of storage spreads. As you all know coming off the volatility we saw with Katrina and Rita, we saw the strongest market value for high deliverability storage. We continue to believe that Jefferson Island is a premiere location for rapid cycle, high deliverability storage and we have seen that the interest from our customers is at a high level, and that demonstrates that the service requirements far exceed our available capacity. One of the things that we are looking at for guidance for 2010 and we will go through each of the different components when we have our analyst meeting, I guess its the month after next, its that we really don't want to have a great deal of reliance on trading as a large component of our total earnings generated. Our belief though still is the fundamental value of high deliverability storage in the Gulf Coast is very strong. In addition to stepping up its marketing efforts in Georgia, SouthStar will also continue to focus on growing its presence in the Ohio market through participation in the unbundled auction process there. The various factors that could cause such material difference are included in our press released and are more fully described in our 10-K filing. It uniquely is connected to pipelines to serve Florida so that has some advantages. And we do anticipate based upon the schedule we see today that we will be in the process early in the second half of this year starting to put Cavern 1 in service. But we are still in that mode of controlling our costs and plan to continue to do that and Hank can add a little more detail. And then I think John's points about cost-efficiency just will continue to manage very carefully. Very much in line with the pro-forma economics we put forward for our storage project. We are in the process of recontracting, as an example, on a regular basis Jefferson Island. And you look at the extra income that they generated primarily in the 4th quarter because of cold weather, it was a big part of that extra $0.10 gap that we had at the end of the year. But clearly our focus has been and will continue to be a very efficient preferred operator of utility assets. The first and largest driver was an $8 million increase in the margin from storage carrying costs. And a number of natural gas plants that have been installed that are running the low load factors that we think for environmental and other reasons we'll start to see higher load factors. Also, revenue for AGL networks was lower as a result of a network expansion project we completed and sold to a customer in 2008. The agreements won't change materially in 2010. And what we have seen recently for storage located at the right place like Jefferson Island, we have seen a return to a positive trend. And then if I could just shift to Sequent as we look forward to what is baked into 2010 guidance, is there anyway to, and lord knows with market conditions these buckets will shift around, but just as you look at it today we have got $30 million coming in from storage. Our case also requests a rate alignment factor, which is a form of decoupling design to remove the [disincentive] for selling less natural gas and that allows us to promote customer conservation and energy efficiency programs. Before we remove to the prepared remarks, let me remind you that our discussion today may contain forward looking statements, and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. We expect that, that will take the majority of this year to move through , and that would allow us to start drilling the Cavern 3 and starting to leach it out early in that year which basically would be an 18-month process or so after that to get that cavern in service. That can drive value for storage as well. How are you seeing the market in the Gulf Coast shaping up in terms of the supply demand fundamentals around storage? You may recall that this project included the purchase of an undivided interest in some of Southern Natural Gas assets that we combined with existing Atlanta Gas Light distribution pipeline to create a firm transportation path into the Atlanta market from Elba island. How are you viewing the composition or the strength perhaps from the transport as well as commercial activity? Our focus still will be, moving forward, though to minimize the cost on our customers and to help our shareholders to keep costs under control. As you may recall, Sequent started 2009 with virtually no storage inventory roll out from 2008, and our historical average is closer to about $12 million. And then just one question concerning your storage cavern investments, can you give us an update as far as where you are on scheduling or you're planning on I want to be adding those new caverns over the next several years? We did not see significant hedge gains or loss on storage in 2009, so year-over-year our storage gains declined by $36 million as we saw significant hedge movement in 2008. If you look at the storage inventory outlook section of the 10-K that's on page 8, we show an inventory withdrawal schedule for Sequent, so you can see the significant storage value Sequent was able to create during the year. More importantly, these investments have no regulatory lag and the recovery mechanism has already been determined and requires no additional rate activity. That schedule shows that we entered 2010 with $30 million of expected operating revenues from our storage positions that we expect to realize primarily in the first quarter of this year, assuming no major changes in the cycling of our inventory as the market conditions change. Most of the volumes there have to be withdrawn by the end of the withdrawal period so since its reservoir storage. In Georgia we put the Magnolia pipeline project in service back in November. In Virginia, we placed the Hampton Roads Crossing project into commercial operation during the first week in January. And one I just wanted to if we could kind of dead reckon again what you think the normalized earnings power of SouthStar is sort of post this migration to the flat pricing system. We still feel very good about the strength of the natural gas market and that does drive the need for high deliverable storage to serve those. Revenue from the Hampton Roads and Magnolia pipeline projects which contributed $2 million above the prior year's results. Transportation has been stressed recently but storage has been very attractive to us. And a key part of what happened last year in terms of commercial activity was kind of the mild summer we had with no storms in the Gulf. And the second question, years ago the focus or the mantra was, we are the efficient guys. In Georgia, we received approval in January and that was approval of Atlanta Gas Light's filing to spend up to $45 million under a new program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas where gas service is not currently available. But clearly, we are well optimistic about 2010. The pipeline connects the northern and southern areas of our Virginia natural gas distribution system, improving the reliability and access to supply for [B and G's] customers. Turning to our storage projects, we continue to make good progress on building out the first cavern of the Golden Triangle storage facility in Texas. We are moving forward with the permitting process for the expansion of the Jefferson Island storage facility. <strong>John Somerhalder</strong> Jefferson Island is really a premier location given the liquidity around the Henry hub and how it is connected. Keep in mind that the 2008 results included $24 million in lower of cost or inventory evaluation adjustments, as compared to only $6 million in 2009. What I say about commercial activity it's the way we capture it excludes what was generated on transportation this year, and so we locked ourselves into its calculation a little bit and so I'm not sure if it is quite a strong an indicator as it has been in the past. In the energy investment segment, we record EBIT of $12 million, that's down $7 million from last year. It hasn't changed materially from the beginning of 2009 to about where we are today. These expenses were offset partially by $5 million in lower costs attributed to fleet fuel costs, marketing expenses, and bad debt expense. Offsetting that, was a $36 million year-over-year increase in realized gains as a result of our ability to capture profits on transportation positions in 2009, relative to last year as we saw basis spreads narrow significantly during the year. The real story however for wholesale in 2009, is that we created significant economic value in both the storage and transportation segments of our business, but the transportation value was realized during the year while the majority of our storage value will be realized in 2010. <strong>Hank Linginfelter</strong> Sure, I would add, Craig, that on the sharing components, I think all of the jurisdictions, we have a contract with Sequent in every jurisdiction for asset management have grown to appreciate Sequent's transparency and ability to share, all the details on how they do business. We anticipate getting the necessary approvals to move forward by year-end, and that will allow us to begin construction early next year. And so to the extent that Sequent is able to make more money around particularly storage and transportation assets than the sharing amount with the utilities will increase. The decline is primarily related to lower interruptible revenues at Jefferson Island and higher business development expense for Golden Triangle and other future projects. In our distribution business, we had a solid year, especially given the slight declines in customer accounts year-over-year. And we also have long term capacity contracts also this pipeline to serve two utilities in the region. As you know, we have been working on two significant utility pipeline projects, and I am happy to report that both of these projects are now in commercial operations. We're going to keep rates flat, but look for profit sharing to maximize the use of otherwise under utilized or inefficiently deployed utility assets with your management trading arm. And that's what we anticipated when we put together the economics on that project. We had a similar project, but smaller project in 2009. With Jefferson Island, as you have heard, we are now back on track to move the permitting process forward. <strong>Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs</strong> I guess maybe just a little more macro on storage. An $11 million decline in operating margin reflects lower commercial activity realized during the year. So we have those data points and obviously Sequent is in the market for storage on a regular basis. But just curious on your view if you see unregulated storage as a possible fit for MLP status.",empty

As a result, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and good access to the capital markets. Currently we have two BCF under contract and we’re looking to optimize the remaining four BCF as the year progresses. Moving quickly to our energy investment segment, which is detailed in Slide 9, you can see that our 2010 EBIT of $4 million was down significantly from the $12 million we recorded in 2009. We successfully completed dewatering Cavern 1 prior to the end of the year and we are currently removing the gas that we use for the dewatering process. And we are starting to look at innovative uses for natural gas such as the LNG for transportation program we have announced in connection with El Paso. Our request brings a portion of the Hampton Roads Crossing facility into rate base and also includes increases in base rates for maintenance and improvements of the distribution system. Our operating expenses excluding the cost of gas in the distribution segment increased just 2%, which is primarily a function of expected higher payroll, compensation and benefits cost. In addition to our basic business refinancing activities we successfully established and syndicated a $1.05 billion bridge facility to support the proposed Nicor transaction that will be replaced with long-term debt financing prior to closing the acquisition. You may recall that we spent roughly $150 million to construct Hampton Roads and we have been allowed to capitalize the cost of carry. So beginning with our distribution business, it performed very well in 2010. With our distribution, retail, wholesale and storage assets, we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends. Turning to Slide 12 I will review some of our major operational accomplishments for last year and will then address our priorities for 2011 including an update on the Nicor merger before moving into the Q&A session. However, these favorable weather conditions were offset by the effect of continued strong competition for customers in the Georgia market and a continuing but slowing migration to fixed price plans, which generally produce lower margin. We have seen a $10 million improvement in year over year commercial activity and OEM expenses in this business have declined 12% or $7 million mainly as a result of lower incentive compensation costs. Retail accounted for 20%, wholesale for 10% and energy investments for the remainder. Utility rate cases are increasingly complex and require significant amounts of time and energy from our staff. Though the EIA reports somewhat increased withdrawals over the last two weeks due to colder than normal temperatures, storage levels remain at relatively high historical levels for this type of year. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. Total remaining CapEx for this project is approximately $40 million. When you factor in the environmental benefits of natural gas generation that likelihood is even greater. Our capital expenditures for 2010 were up $34 million over the prior year, which primarily reflected the additional spending related Golden Triangle Storage facility, the Strive projects in Georgia and the utility infrastructure programs in New Jersey. AGL Resources continues to be a leader among its LDC peers by many measures including safety, efficiency, low cost of service and stable financial results regardless of economic conditions. The vast shale gas reserves mean that natural gas prices should stay low for the foreseeable future relative to coal and crude oil, making it more likely that power generation will rely increasingly on natural gas. Finally, and this is another one that you’ll always hear from the AGL Resources management team, we’ll be focused on controlling expenses and maintaining capital discipline in each of our business segments. At our storage business as most of you know, Cavern 1 at Golden Triangle began initial operations on schedule in September of last year and we’ve been serving a 2BCF contract. And on the right, note that our distribution business continues to be the largest contributor to EBIT, representing 59% of total EBIT in 2010. If this combination of robust production and high storage inventories persist it likely means continued low volatility and lower margins in terms of optimizing our storage and pipeline assets. The mark to market impact in 2010 resulted from changes in forward nimax prices, which impacted storage hedges and changes in forward basis differentials, which impacted transportation hedges. Further, though prices for storage are lower than they were when we initiated construction on the project due to many of the supply and demand factors that we’ve discussed earlier, when combined with our existing 2BCF contract our all in blended rate will be higher than prevailing market rates. On the left you can see that despite volatile conditions in the natural gas market over the past few years we’ve managed to produce stable and consistent results across the business. During 2010 we successfully completed nearly $1.2 billion of refinancing activity including the renewal of our $1 billion senior credit facility that supports our commercial paper program and refinancing of $161 million in credit facilities backing our outstanding revenue bonds. The increase is principally due to the addition of earnings from the pipeline projects we put into service last year, Hampton Roads Crossing in Virginia and Magnolia Project in Georgia. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-K. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. The main component of our filing is a requested increase of $25 billion with a mitigation plan to phase in the new rates over three years. Wrapping up our prepared remarks today, the natural gas industry is poised for growth as the economy recovers and as we turn more towards clean burning domestic fuels. And as I mentioned, we’ll be looking to contract more Cavern 1 at Golden Triangle as well as to continue the build out of Cavern 2, which is expected to be operational in 2012. Sequent had a strong finish to the year with the cold December weather possibly impacting the asset values in our eastern US and Gulf Coast gas portfolios as pipeline constraints on several eastern pipelines increased the value of firm assets. The new rates have been in effect for about three months now and we’ll continue to see benefits in terms of both financial results and operational improvements for our customers. We continued our discipline in controlling costs throughout the year. By utilizing marketing and customer retention programs, Salstar successfully maintained stable market share of 33% in Georgia in 2010 with our customer count remaining around 500,000. Since we have been recognizing the cost of carry, the impact of the rate case is not expected to be material to our earnings. From an operational perspective we have already formed a transition team that is chaired by Drew with leadership from senior executives of both companies. We continue to expect earnings increases of about 4-6% per year going forward and we maintain our policy of increasing dividends while growing earnings.","But Nicor is a very good operator of the facilities so we have to show that quality of service for the customers. We would expect somewhere from 1000-2000 data requests to go through the process but I don’t see anything that would keep the deal from happening. One is Nicor has provided high quality, reliable service and they want to make sure that everything we do shows that we can continue to provide that service. Andrew Evans You know, I’d just say that synergy tends to be a dirty word and we think of it really as synergies and efficiencies. And then clearly at the holding company level, those synergies look very much in line. The synergies between their storage business, which is more depleted aquifer and reservoir background and expertise there and ours is more salt dome but bringing that together and having more opportunities to expand under the right conditions and have different type facilities to expand. I think what we talked about before is that 1/3 of those or some portion of those will come from general holding company overlap and the balance comes from either consolidation reduction expense in unregulated operations or improved margin related to the overlay of businesses that we discussed a lot I think in sort of the last question. We will go through the process with the commission and make sure they’re comfortable with that transaction and then we’ll move forward. John Somerhalder What you’re talking about is clearly we provided benefit back to our customers through efficiently managing assets. And we think that in this instance we bought a business at a very nice multiple of cash flow in particular. So we’ll consider those different opportunities but clearly now given that unique set of circumstances of the shale production, very high storage levels, it is a more challenging time to contract for that. If we look how we’re positioned on some of our transportation portfolio compared to just a year ago, that’s favorable. Carl, this is Pete Tumminello and I’ll just add that we have grown our producer services business, which is more of a fee and service based group with all the Marcellus and Haynesville and other shale plays that fit well into our transportation portfolio. But the base plan would be to find more contracts for the next 4BCF of capacity. That’s probably the difference there is I think your projections in the S4 were probably a little bit lower than consensus. The projections that are in the S4 are the basis for our valuation of the business. We have the time to find the right way to move forward on either contracting for that facility or optimizing it under one of these other scenarios. We’re probably buying with the lowest content of tropic shipping earnings in the EPS calculation. But should we be expecting to see contracts on that or is that something maybe because you have that first 2BCF at prior market rates, that gives you some comfort that you can maybe wade into 2012 or whenever to see if storage rates perhaps strengthen? Questions will be taken in the order received. Peter Tumminello I think that’s a very, very good question and I believe the answer is we are seeing some favorable movement upward in the business and really it’s due to I think a very good focus of taking the assets to the producers on one end of the pipeline and to the power generators on the other end of the pipeline as well as the commercial and industrial markets and some success in those fee and service based businesses that are less volatility dependent. The only other real material change in there is a preliminary estimate of purchase price allocation and the resulting amortizations that would occur. You know, you’ve got some projection in the S4 but most analysts don’t reach us that much past about 2011 or 2012. And with that cold weather it brought tremendous volatility and we have a lot of optionality in those assets to bring gas to our various customers off of multiple pipelines. And then I guess lastly, you know the projections for 2011 and the historical for Nicor were much below where the Street is again and I guess obviously you’re privy in talking to the company. I mean initially it seemed like there was good upside with synergies from the combination with storage. We do have a diverse portfolio into the Midwest and the west as well but the largest transport and storage portfolio that we have is in the east. In distribution in particular the customer loss in 2010 was much mitigated to what our initial expectations were. It’s a long process. So all the things Pete mentioned plus the group’s ability to reposition those contracts and those positions in storage and transportation has provided the ability to stay on that trajectory and you talked about growth in that business. And as we’ve talked about, because of the low volatility, high storage levels, high flowing gas, now is not the best time to enter into long-term contracts. Andrew Evans And let me also add it was not only the strength of their cash flow and how we looked at that and multiples of that but also the strength of their balance sheet that allowed us to move forward in a way that was favorable to their shareholders and our shareholders. And then if I could just follow up with another question on the wholesale business, in the fourth quarter I guess you guys mentioned that December was definitely colder than normal and that helped you generate a significant amount of operating margin in the month. We had the ability to accelerate some storage withdrawals and sell into a higher priced market. We have seen significant increases in the power generation demands from gas and the storage and transport portfolio that we have is growing in that area. We have also grown significantly our gas for fuel to power generators. Our retail business is more commodity focused. That’s a very good indication but longer term synergies and distribution operations to keep costs lower long term, the opportunities look promising to make sure that we can avoid future rate increases and that our customers will over the long term feel the benefit. We look at transactions on the basis of accretion to shareholder value and also accretion to cash generation for business. The pro forma that we provided in the S4 is consistent with the data that we’ve provided to Nicor for their valuation purposes and leaves out a number of factors we think are accretive to earnings but were consistent with the way we were doing a five-year plan for our part and thought it was the most prudent and practical projection to provide for Nicor. And so I think the best way to use that is to look at the amortizations, look at the balance sheet implications and look at our expected costs for merger related costs for the two and you could apply those to any forward projection. I mean we clearly have a view that just like we’ve seen in the past storage rates have always been cyclical and we’ve seen them go to lower levels and come out. We also had some of our large power generation customers burn significant volumes in December and we served a lot of that volume on a daily as well as intra-day market. And I guess as now you’re a little further in the process I wonder if you could put any more color around that if it’s a little more opportunity there than initially might have been thought? Just going into the S4 a little bit more, taking a look at the management financial projections, it looks like on 2012 and ’13 you guys need about 100 million of pre-tax synergies to break even to consensus EPS. So we don’t expect a materially different number than the type of trajectory we’ve seen in the past because of the way Pete and the team have stabilized that business. In Illinois they choose a higher depreciation rate, which means a more rapid return of cash flow to the corporation and they had good investment opportunities in their existing rate base and that was the principal driver for the acquisition. We’ll consider shorter term contracts but we also have the ability with our own team through services like park and loans and other ways to optimize that asset to make sure that we get the results in 2011 that we have talked about within this guidance range. The synergies that we discussed I think on our earlier calls were in the range of sort of 4-5% of combined non-fuel OEM. But in general, yes, when we look at the range in total we have taken into account that storage rates in this time period are lower than they have been historically."

In addition to the impact of lower commercial activity during 2011, we had storage and transportation hedge gains that were $21 million higher than the prior-year, but we also recorded LOCOM in 2011 that was $24 million higher than in 2010 reflecting the decline in natural gas prices during the latter half of the year. As expected Sequent continues to face the challenges of lower market volatility and lower price spreads for storage and transportation. Our guidance assumes several factors that we achieved appropriate progress towards 2012 or during 2012 towards the run-rate efficiencies we expect from the Nicor merger, that we’ve no rate case activity in 2012 from our regulated utilities, that we experienced minimal growth in our retail businesses and that the challenging market conditions I described for our Wholesale, Midstream, and Cargo Shipping businesses persist throughout the year. For example, earlier this year, we filed for a new pipeline replacement program in Virginia under the State’s Save Program. Also you will note that we have modified our reporting segments to better reflect our operation post merger. For retail and Wholesale, we will focus on maintaining market share in our core service territories and expand into new markets. Wholesale operations include Sequent and Nicor Interchange. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. Midstream operations, includes our non-utility storage assets with the addition of Nicor Central Valley Gas Storage project and Cargo Shipping reflects the addition of Nicor’s Tropical Shipping units. Note that the Nicor EBIT loss of $90 million includes $34 million of change in control payments that were triggered when the merger closed. Now let’s move to slide 11, EBIT in our Midstream operation segment improved by $3 million in 2011 compared to 2010. For storage, our primary goal is to bring our storage facilities online -- that the ones that are currently under construction and contract them at the best -- the combination of the best available rates and duration to optimize a portfolio in a very challenging market. Our retail business continues to generate stable earnings results despite some of the competitive pressures we face, particularly in the Georgia market. This issue alone is expected to impact earnings by about $0.07 per share, increased expenses related to pipeline integrity and maintenance and an outstanding diluted share count of approximately 117.5 million reflecting the full effect of the shares we issued as part of the Nicor purchase price. Our 2011 GAAP results included 22 days of operations from Nicor as a result of our merger closing on December 9. EBIT was up $60 million for the year or 17% compared to last year including an EBIT contribution of $15 million from the 22 days that Nicor Gas was included in our distribution results. In the past 2 years, the earnings decline in shipping has resulted from a combination of fewer TEUs or twenty-foot equivalent units being shipped and higher fuel costs that cannot always be easily passed along to customers. Retail operations accounted for 18%, Midstream operations for 2% and Wholesale services 1%. Our performance at distribution operations was $38 million favorable to our guidance, but Wholesale was $48 million unfavorable to guidance. There were no material earnings contributions from the Cargo Shipping segment for the 22 days that we owned it in 2011. Just to remind you, transportation storage hedge gains or losses and LOCOM are non-cash items, but impact the timing of reported income. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Our non-utility capital spending will be around $100 million primarily reflecting the build-out of the second cavern Golden Triangle Storage and the completion of Central Valley Gas storage projects, both of which we expect to be completed in the first half of this year. Distribution operations include the legacy AGL Resources utilities plus Nicor Gas. Retail operations include SouthStar plus Nicor’s Retail Energy and Services businesses. The rollout schedule year-over-year is lower primarily due to lower seasonal spreads resulting from lower volatility associated with robust natural gas supply and ample storage as well as warmer weather versus the prior-year. The largest component of the EBIT decline came from $45 million reduction in commercial activity versus last year. Specifically our guidance includes achievement of anticipated efficiencies related to corporate overhead and non-utility businesses as a result of the Nicor merger, the persistence of a low natural gas price and volatility environment for the foreseeable future, pension expense for 2012 that is expected to be significantly higher than 2011 due to lower discount rates. Unfortunately, market fundamentals have degraded even further in those businesses since our last call in October, as a result of mild weather, unseasonably high storage levels and other factors. This would be a $100 million program aimed at enhancing the reliability and integrity of the natural gas distribution system in Virginia, while supporting the local economy by providing jobs. As with our Wholesale and Midstream businesses we do not anticipate a change in the market conditions in 2012, but we’ll be focused on controlling fixed-cost in the business and evaluating new customer opportunities. We've not included a slide here for our new Cargo Shipping segment as there was no material EBIT contribution from the segment for the 22 days that we owned the business since 2011. The decline in year-over-year earnings is largely driven by several factors impacting our Wholesale Services business, including lower natural gas price spreads, lower volatility and takeaway capacity constraints that affected us, particularly, in the third quarter. And importantly, at our regulated businesses, we continue to operate with a backdrop of fair rate case outcomes from recent years over 40% of regulated capital expenditures under writer programs, constructive regulatory relationships in all of our jurisdictions and the recent approval of Illinois Commerce Commission for this transformative merger. Importantly, in 2012 we will continue to build on the work we began in 2011 to integrate the legacy AGL Resources businesses with Nicor across each segment and to generate the efficiencies we‘ve discussed that are central to the success of the transaction. The improvement was due to increased revenue at Golden Triangle Storage, which we put into commercial operation in the third quarter of last year. We’re proposing a 5-year modernization plan under which we plan to replace over 200 miles of aging pipeline. Of this $45 million, $23 million was due to ongoing low volatility conditions and tight storage and transportation spreads. I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on slide 8. At Cargo shipping, we will continue to focus on managing costs and maintaining a strong brand in the region and across all of our businesses we’ll focus on effectively controlling expenses. On the right you can see that our distribution business continues to be the largest operating segment contributor to EBIT representing approximately 79% of total operating EBIT contributions in 2011. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-K. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures, such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS.","We’ve also contracted for firm storage in that area as well. And that is a good way to optimize it. So that has been a positive, but since these facilities are higher turn facilities and a lot of the value in these facilities counts on the volatility or intraday and in shorter time periods, we just have not seen that simple cycle spread moving out materially, which in fact we’ve seen further compression of the value. Our debt-to-capitalization does not change materially pre and post. And then maybe just 1 other question in understanding really not giving any segment guidance here until next month, but perhaps just looking from fourth quarter, sorry this is also on Sequent, the downdraft in commercial activity excluding of course the Marcellus issue, it seems to be pretty concentrated here in the fourth quarter, and I guess maybe the simple question is, is there any reason to believe that’s changed for the first quarter? The margins are still constrained due to the lower volatility, but we’re seeing the utilization of gas by that market share increase in the services we’re providing there. We do see as our asset cost roll off in 2013 and ’14, some material benefits of those higher costs rolling off and then we’ll be re-contracting similar transactions or those identical transactions at much lower market rates. It is related principally to distribution operations. Similarly, those were taken into account with a lesser expectation from transportation into 2012, so all of that was recalibrated into our ’12 guidance. So we feel very good about the facilities, but that sets up the tougher answer which is, we are seeing continued compression on storage rates and Pete can give you more detail on that. What if any merger savings were included in the 2012 guidance or are you guys kind of just holding that back to talk more about at your conference, Analyst Day? It actually would start to produce -- we’ll see a reduction in the expense naturally, ultimately a generation of income. I mean, the discount rate does in fact influence that, but it doesn’t really change our requirements for investment materially from what we would have expected normally and our goal there is just to make sure that the plans are healthy and funded to reasonable levels in the short-term. Peter I. Tumminello Group President of Commercial Businesses The storage contribution will be up in ’12 versus ’11. I’m just wondering if you’re looking at 2012, have you been able to kind of transform the way that you contracted capacity in that business, and have you been able to move towards primary firm? And then, we always look at that related to re-contracting for capacity in all of those areas, both integration separately looking at our operations related to lower our opportunities and then with re-contracting. Craig Kenneth Shere Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc. Pete, can you quantify in any way if you maintained the total capacity exposures, what assuming current market pricing, the cost savings would be if you reset the 2013 and 2014 expiring contracts down? And so, the goal really is to just remain as efficient and combat the inflations that we’ve in the business. So, that continues to be a part of the way we run our business and other energy marketing trading companies run their business. One is the cash activity that you generate when it’s cold, and that is significantly down in Q4 and you'd obviously expect to see that down in Q1 given the warm weather. Carl Ludwig Kirst BMO Capital Markets U.S. Great, so that mean really by year-end 2014, 75% of capacity today is pretty much rebased? Andrew William Evans Former Director Without a change in rates, we didn’t really make large scale changes to our return assumptions and there wasn’t any real activity in the plans. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO And I’d point out when you look at the impact of the transaction, transition, integration costs and change in control type payments, both for last year and this year, but those costs in total are very consistent with what we had anticipated. So on a day-to-day basis and in the future we’re be -- able to be more opportunistic if constraints come back into that area. We will continue to rollout what now has been more than a decade long pipeline replacement program in Georgia and that program is coming to -- it’s at the final stages, the next year or 2 we’ll largely have finished our program of replacement of pipe, but you recall we did expand into other infrastructure enhancements more than a year-ago with our STRIDE program, that took the PRP and added to that system reliability enhancement and expansion into new communities and towns. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO But recognize -- I mean, we’re in a good situation where we got firm capacity both on the transportation and storage side. But given that, there is some benefit to the single cycle levels for storage now, with this warmer weather and really compressed short-term gas pricing that’s expanded the seasonal 1 turn spread that we’re seeing in the market. We are seeing the same fundamentals that make it hard for the first quarter, but as Pete indicated we have a couple of positive things, and 1 is that, we proactively put on hedges on, as Pete said storage and transportation, at a very good time, which means that even in an environment where we can't capture that value on a real time basis, the hedge allows us to get that value and we’ve seen that. Can you remind me what perhaps storage is held by affiliates between Sequent and Wholesale or Midstream, I guess now, just trying to kind of get a sense of how much of Sequent is contracted for perhaps Jefferson Island or something that just as we rebase everything we’ve got all the moving parts correct? Peter I. Tumminello Group President of Commercial Businesses Yes, and specifically we’ve accounted for firm primary capacity to take care of all of our needs out of that 1 specific area that John mentioned in the Marcellus. We’ve actually more transportation and more storage capacity than we’ve obligations to move. So as Drew said, we’ve had some very smooth processes going through this late year close, and going through all these other issues. First, expense you were talking about for the pension expense, maybe Drew, you want to respond more to this, but I’m assuming that since that’s kind of a retail operation that’s kind of one-time down draft that wouldn’t necessarily carry through in ensuing years predominantly. In a big part of our business, we hold firm transportation. So, in this environment not only can we move and transport all of those the gas that we've purchased in that area, but we now can be in a mode to be opportunistic. We don’t have a real material change in sort of our unfunded status. There are some infrastructure needs for replacement of not only the traditional utility pipeline infrastructure, but some gathering lines in the storage field that the utility owns there. Unknown Analyst Let me ask -- let me a follow-up and ask this question, would it be fair to say though that you still maintain a high BBB type of credit rating target? That does give us an opportunity, but also that capacity came at a higher cost. You did not ask first, but construction and heading towards options were going very well on both of those facilities as far as schedules we see, we’ve just now, we’re in the process of converting Cavern 2 from the leach mode to now the -- where we’re going to dewater. And then Pete also talked earlier about that simple cycle spread moving out. Craig, John spoke to you the impact of the accelerating hedge gains on storage and the resulting lower rollout schedule on storage going into ’12, which certainly came into our guidance calculations. Peter I. Tumminello Group President of Commercial Businesses We are getting set up to go out for some open seasons later in the year on Golden Triangle, Cavern 2 and on the additional unsold capacity at Central Valley. So we do see some benefits in the ’13 and ’14 timeframe coming from those activities and then we’re also seeing significant volume increases from our gas-fired PowerGen customers. Last question, 1 of your peers out there, specifically 1 doing well in some other areas just like you guys are, but having some trouble if the storage and transportation leases and announcing additional right-sizing of that business, contraction of obligations over time to new targeted levels. What happens during that time period though is that it again accelerates forward hedge gains, because we were very well hedged on our storage and transportation portfolio. So we’re getting prepared for that and we’re making sure our cost structure is in line to support that level of activity, but that’s kind of the market assessment. You talked about in the third quarter especially that you’ve managed to shift away from your secondary transportation rights, I guess mostly by September. It really was a discounting of the liability that produced those results. Andrew William Evans Former Director Yes, so these are sort of integration or transition expenses, the lion's share of those costs were incurred in 2011 and a large bulk of those were related to change in control agreements, banker fees and bridge facilities. We accelerated some transportation hedge gains in the fourth quarter of 2011. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO And Ted, it’s somewhat interesting that we are seeing that 1 turn cycle move out as we’ve seen lower gas prices that have impacted current prices more than they’ve impacted next winter’s prices. The other aspect is transportation. And then also with Central Valley with last year we saw fairly robust hydroelectric generation. What we’ve done is exactly what you’ve indicated in the Marcellus though, instead of using firm transportation on a secondary basement -- excuse me, a secondary basis for long-term commitments to move gas out of the Marcellus, we’ve shifted that to firm transportation and Pete can talk a little bit about several arrangements we put in place so that we now can match-up those firm transportation with those firm obligations. Until that environment changes we won’t see a material reduction in our debt-to-total capitalization. It also provides us an insight into natural gas prices and storage and values in all of those areas. Can you give us a sense of how much of the storage and transport capacity comes off in those years or maybe another way to ask it is what's the average duration of those storage and pipeline contracts? Theodore J. Durbin Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And then just last question for me on -- both on Golden Triangle and Central Valley, you’re probably in the process of trying to subscribe those, can you give us a sense what the rates you were looking at for both? We've had some offsets as we’ve talked about, storage spreads have moved up a little bit. We do hold enough capacity and manage enough capacity under asset management agreement, storage capacity that, that gives us some help too. We're on a cycle to review with the Georgia Public Service Commission the next stage of those infrastructure enhancement programs later this year probably, towards the end of the year and we’ll propose to them what we think is appropriate for infrastructure for the next few years."

Fortunately, we do have weather normalization for several of our utilities and effectively hedged a significant portion of our weather risk in our retail operations. We also have provided the approximate quarterly earnings contribution that we expect from our distribution retail and shipping segments, so you can see the anticipated shape of our earnings distribution across the year. Though our payout ratio has increased a bit relative to the peer group due to weaker earnings in 2012, again, we are generating strong cash flows to support the dividend. We are very proud of the significant time and effort invested by our people across all of our businesses to accomplish key merger integration and operational milestones this past year, and I am confident that their efforts will result in long-term benefits for the combined company. We ended the year with a storage rollout schedule of $27 million, which you can see on Slide 8, and we expect to realize that value in operating revenues in 2013. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and more fully described in today's 10-K filing. During the year, we replaced more than 280 miles of aging pipeline infrastructure across our footprint, continuing our strategy of deploying capital into regulated business in a way that minimizes regulatory lag and ensures timely recovery of and on our capital. While there were some factors beyond our control, such as weather and marks related to our wholesale positions, we were successful in achieving cost savings relative to the Nicor merger at our forecasted level of $60 million. Taking into account our fourth quarter transportation hedge losses, as well as transportation hedge gains realized earlier in 2012, we have about $7 million of economic value related to transportation hedge positions that we expect to realize in 2013. You can see the blended rates for each storage facility on the chart at the bottom right side of this page. Overall, the market for storage remains weak, but we continue to focus on ways to optimize the value of our available capacity while not committing to long-term contracts in this low price environment. The proper maintenance and operation of our distribution system is paramount to the health of our company, so you will see us continue to invest in these areas. Wholesale is expected to contribute approximately $30 million, driven by a strong storage rollout schedule in 2012 and the recruitment of losses association with transportation positions. The merging of the plans was a significant undertaking, and we are pleased to have accomplished this one -- just one year into the merged operations. Cash flows generated by our operations were more than $1 billion in 2012, supporting our ongoing commitment to increase dividends, which you see on Slide 16. Our SouthStar joint venture continued to perform well and maintained its market-leading position in Georgia while expanding into other markets when it can do so profitably. The administrative law judge issued a proposed order in November, which included a recommended amount that was $8 million higher than our settlement with the ITC staff, and we are awaiting a final ruling from the Illinois Commerce Commission. We have worked with the management team at Tropical to maximize efficiencies in this business, and we are all focused on appropriately improving profitability per TEU. In 2012, the Chicago area had 19% fewer heating degree days than the 10-year average, and this weather impact reduced our EBIT in the distribution business by $24 million. As a result, even with the historically warm weather, we had a negative impact of only about $32 million on an EBIT basis in our distribution operations and our retail operations businesses. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. While hedge movements in our accounting results can sometimes mask the true economic value generated by the wholesale segment, I do want to highlight this increase in value during the quarter and throughout the year. In addition, while our Wholesale Service business generated higher economic value during the year, in part supported by its storage rollout schedule, mark-to-market accounting on our hedge positions resulted in a year-over-year negative impact to reported earnings. As you know, we expected to generate at least $60 million of savings across the enterprise following the close of the Nicor transaction. First, I wanted to highlight some significant operational accomplishments for 2012, particularly in our Distribution Operations segment, where we continue to focus on being the leader in the sector with regard to pipeline safety, maintenance and upgrades. Forward-looking statements involve matters that are not historical facts, and our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from our actual results. We recognize that we face significant challenges in our wholesale, midstream and shipping segments, and we'll continue to work to position these businesses for success as market fundamentals improve. For the full year, EBIT declined by $8 million due mainly to transportation and storage hedge gains that were lower in aggregate than in 2011, though commercial activity improved year-over-year. Market share and utilization are slowly improving. In closing, while our 2012 financial results were disappointing relative to our expectations, our core distribution and retail businesses are stable, healthy and continue to perform well. Our wholesale business continues to be a low-risk energy marketing business focused on serving our utilities, third-party utilities, power generation and producers. We have a much clearer picture now that we've operated the combined businesses through a difficult year, and our 2013 guidance reflects both our expected opportunities and our challenges. As such, the negative weather impact represents only about 1.5% of the total operating margin for our distribution segment for 2012. We were able to achieve our targeted savings primarily across our distribution, retail and Wholesale Services segment. As we noted in our January press release, we had mark-to- market losses of $22 million related to the transportation positions along the Northeast corridor. A snapshot of fourth quarter and full year EBIT for our distribution business is on Slide 5. The increase mainly reflects the addition of Nicor's retail businesses to our portfolio, as well as a reduction in transportation and gas costs and lower bad debt expense at SouthStar. While we expect our EBIT results to be unchanged year-over-year at Distribution Operations, this does not reflect our strong cash generation.","I think the -- you might recall, we're in a 3-year stay out in Illinois around general rate cases that was part of the merger on order. I was a little surprised at Sequent with the modest guidance given $27 million built in from the storage rollout schedule. So that's how we're looking at the year as a challenging year from the standpoint of storage values and price volatility impacting our business. But as fewer facilities get built over time, as industrial loads start improving, as exports start improving, fundamentally, we do see that returning and growing off of that number, but it is hard to estimate how much it will grow off of that number. And then where do we stand on the roll-off of above market legacy contracts or overhead for both pipeline capacity and storage at Sequent? So that gave some value to storage above what we see this year. Even though this year we're seeing colder weather and we've seen some volatility because of that, we haven't seen enough to move the storage value up. I think we have a slide in here that shows how the rollout changed significantly quarter-to-quarter, and we'd expect the greatest amount of noise in that because of the storage levels in the second and third quarter. But how much, and I guess, Pete, I'll throw this to you, but how much do you think is perpetually systemic just because the new kind of manufacturing-like work-in-process shale drilling results in virtual storage anyhow, so people aren't just worried about getting what their needs are? Or does that include what you expect to generate from commercial activity too? So we're somewhat in a middle position where that impact not only storage and storage rates, but that's also impacting our outlook for the new commercial value we can capture with energy market and trade with our Sequent business. So a lot will depend on projections and what we see happening as far as recovery of the fundamentals in the midstream, wholesale and in the shipping businesses. Roughly $0.30 of tighter spreads ballpark compared to this time last year, and that's the material reason for not being more aggressive on guidance in 2013. So what we want to do is give -- I think people struggled this year with being able to compare operational performance to some of the guidance that we gave and it was perturbed by the mark-to-market noise. Gulf Coast storages tend to be more impacted by the systemic growth of shale, and those will have to only recover when shale volumes temper or they're offset by material growth in industrial power demand and exports. We've got to absorb what we've got and make sure that we can operate it efficiently. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO There's a portion that gets capitalized as part of our overhead on our capital programs, so not all of it hits the bottom line and what you see calculated. Our next set of priorities really relates to our own distribution businesses and in the retail energy component here in Georgia. And in midstream storage, what is the cents per Mcf month pricing of the 3.4 Bcf at JISH and 2.0 Bcf at Golden Triangle contract expirations this year? Andrew William Evans Former Director And Craig, I mean, that's an important point because what we are seeing this year if you look at the fourth quarter and how this year has started out compared to last year; last year, because storage was so full and we had such mild weather in the fourth quarter of the year before and then early in 2012, the storage spreads had -- the single-cycle storage spreads seasonally had moved out because of that full storage. So we're somewhat in a middle position where we're not getting the benefit of storage congestion that helps storage and volatility value. Andrew William Evans Former Director Yes, I mean I think in total, retail services represents a relatively small -- not that small -- smallish component of retail in total, but we haven't addressed the Georgia, Virginia, Florida, Chattanooga or New Jersey markets. We're getting enough weather to pull storage levels down but not enough to drive significant volatility. What really backs that up is our view that we're seeing a storage market that is materially tighter in terms of the spreads compared to this time last year. But over this next 1 year to 2 years, it will be important for us to look at ways to invest in infrastructure, depreciation rates, potentially weather normalization, the right things that work both for our customers in Illinois and will produce continued better results out of that business."

As we've mentioned on prior calls, we have maintained a small but critical infrastructure team in order to manage our pipeline of nurses who are in a waiting pattern to come to the US. The number of new contracts increased 6% sequentially, which will help drive future revenue from search and placement activities. The year-over-year increase in revenue was due to a 1% increase in days filled, combined with a 6% increase in revenue per day filled. But the willingness of nonhospital-based imaging centers to use outside labor to manage the work load has tightened. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and our current reports on Form 8-K, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. But we have also made some internal changes that have helped us drive this demand increase and convert more orders into placements. Turning to our international division, we remain optimistic that the continued impact of a bottleneck immigration environment will be resolved. As we announced earlier today, we are planning a share repurchase program of up to $38 million, which we expect to be substantially completed by the end of 2008. The results are encouraging, with the number of new facility contracts exceeding our expectations, the number of preferred relationships rising and the aggregate number of orders up significantly since the beginning of the year. As we finished the first four months of the year, I am pleased to report we have made important progress towards achieving our goals, both operational and financial. While we are not planning on separately reporting on Platinum Select, given its relative size, we are reporting this quarter only that it contributed approximately $7 million of revenue in the first quarter and is expected to generate approximately $15 million of revenue in the second quarter. This business generated revenue growth of 6% year-over- year. Every week, you will likely see a national report or an article acknowledging the continued struggles fueling the physician shortage. In aggregate, our volume, which we measure as days filled for the quarter, was slightly higher with a 1% increase over last year and 2% over last quarter. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. As the actual number of shares to be acquired and the timing of these repurchases is dependent on our available operating cash flow, it's uncertain what the actual accretion will be in 2008. Revenue generated by our nurse and allied staffing segment this quarter was $204 million, compared to $200 million last year and $197 million last quarter. Revenue generated by our locum tenens staffing segment this quarter was $76 million, an increase of 7% compared to last year and relatively flat to last quarter. As in the past, we expect to have better visibility on our projected growth during the second half of the year when we report our second quarter results. We are confident that AMN, as the industry leader, will continue demonstrating the strategic and operational ability to deliver greater client value in what is truly an ever-changing and demanding environment. Today, the integration process and response to the acquisition has been very positive and Platinum is on track with their growth expectations for the year. During the quarter, we expanded our allied service offering with the launch of a permanent placement service for therapy specialties, and the addition of recruitment and placement of clinical laboratory technicians for short-term travel. It affects the ability of healthcare providers to deliver quality care.","With the technicians, it's a little bit to do with supply as well. In that hospitals are always trying to find the best balance between their core permanent staff and flexible staffing. Certainly, the acute care setting is our largest and will likely always be our largest component within nursing. And I wanted to ask a question about cash flow for the year. And it's translated into increased orders and increased placements for us. For the last several weeks, as you noted, there's appeared to be some anecdotal evidence, not least of which was the Wall Street Journal article this morning that's highlighting at least a temporary relief in the supply softness on the nursing side. David Dreyer And Tobey, if your question was related just to locums, the pricing really shows up on the year-over-year basis with the revenue per day filled. But what we are seeing is the supply of locums remain relatively strong. And so, we have seen the supply of that type of clinician kind of move more quickly when the demand rises. A real competitive advantage we have is that we have more assignments available in more locations than any other company within the industry and we want to maintain that advantage. So, that's probably why we continue to get our greatest supply from that kind of semi-retired demographics. And this is a way for them to maintain that work/life balance. And again continue to see a lot of strength there in terms of the kind of sheer numbers of orders, one of our biggest gainers in a quarter-over-quarter. It's really more of an ongoing process. Again, really more based on available operating cash flow, as that's our intent of how we're going to fund it. And again, I'm not going to give an estimate relative to the share buyback because we really -- there are so many unknowns, i.e., the pricing, the cash flow required, the timing of when we make those purchases. One is that the facilities themselves are more strapped with lower reimbursement rates and trying to squeeze more productivity out of the staff that they have. And then just finally, on the locums side, the revenue per day or … David Dreyer Revenue per day filled? Dawn J. P. Morgan Quickly, I just wanted to focus a little bit on the supply side. Nurses that are sitting in the pipeline are at different points in the process and so, at the soonest, it would be four months. So, it's something where we're always trying to do a better job of negotiating better rates in conjunction with the quality and the experience of the clinician we're providing. I think the only -- there's nothing substantially different in our operating cash flow going forward. Is there anything unusual or should we just anticipate the typical seasonal cash flow that improves in the latter quarters of the year? If there were, we'd be placing people at a faster clip because you're always short of supply. So we don't mind that increasing as long as we can do it in an efficient way. Not that we're huge but it's definitely been going up and so that's also added to our not operating cash flow but to our overall cash flow requirements as well. But we haven't seen anything recently in our supply or for that matter in our demand that would suggest that there's been a very recent change. Some of that is driven by the increased costs that they're experiencing with fuel and utilities and sort of some of the same things that are affecting us and some of it is competitively driven. Susan Nowakowski Sure, it would likely be four to six months by the time we get them through the remaining process. And again, depending on how our cash flow works, we plan to do most of it by the end of 2008. And at the same time, remember, while the revenue -- we have a revenue pickup, we would be increasing our infrastructure in order to resume our recruitment to help build a pipeline for the future. In listening to our clients, watching our demand trends and our supply trends today, we believe we're still on course for a sequential pickup from the second to the third quarter. I was wondering in the supply of either new candidates or existing locums, doctors with whom you have a dialogue, if you're seeing that younger population increase? But at the same time, we've seen an increase in our furniture and utilities, largely due to rising fuel costs and the furniture companies desiring to pass those on. So, it's a bit of an -- I wouldn't say it's an excess supply but it's more supply that's coming to the markets to help fill the perm positions. It's not that we had -- even though the radiology, as Susan explained, really the majority of that 6% increase year-over-year for revenue per day filled is pricing related. In 2007, there was a bump in housing, as in some cases you were trying to increase the supply of nurses willing to travel. One, is working with vendor management software organizations that are not direct competitors with us but are trying to provide the facilities with better tools to manage and get a view as to the utilization of their outsource staffing. It does change, though, the way we have to handle some operational things. David Dreyer Our cash flow in the first quarter was really nothing unusual."

While nursing rebook rates sell at the beginning of the year in line with the lower demand, we have seen more stability over the past few months and although the overall new supply of candidates is down, we have seen a noticeable increase in the percentage of applicants that are coming from competitors, which is probably an indication of the lack of assignment selection amongst the smaller firms. Pricing continues to be stable across most of our business lines, helping to maintain or improve gross margins. First, continuing to deliver our superior levels of quality and service and building on our client base and breadth of offerings. In addition to launching our Emergency Medicine division, we continue to nurture the new service offerings launched last year, such as recruitment process outsourcing and staffing services in the home health market and ambulatory surgery centers. In response to the market environment, we have redirected our internal resources from supply recruiting activities, towards demand generating sales functions. One of our greatest strengths is how we perform in a market rebound. The timing and impact of healthcare reform are uncertain, but in nearly any scenario they are likely to increase the demand for quality clinicians. In order to provide more operating flexibility, especially given the current economic uncertainty, we have finalized an agreement with our lending group to amend key covenants and extend the term of our existing revolving credit. The decline was driven primarily by lower new retained search activity. Second, proactively adjusting our cost structure and capturing additional productivity gains in a way that will allow us to flex upward when the market returns. Over the past two months, we have seen some stabilization in nursing order levels but it is still too early to tell whether we are in near an inflection point. All of our Locum specialties experienced improved fill rates, and we believe there is an opportunity to continue improving our execution and increasing our fill rates to grow revenues across all of our specialties. Short-term demand trends do remain challenging as the economic environment has temporarily reduced nurse attrition and expanded the available supply of hours from previously retired or part-time clinicians. This is a time when our size, and our 25 year history of consistent focus on quality and service are rewarded by our clients. Our ability to remain agile and execute well in the short term while maintaining a focus on our long-term strategy will enable us to emerge from this economic cycle better positioned to further expand our leadership position in the industry. During the first quarter, we generated 38 million of operating cash flow which was used primarily to pay down the revolving credit facility. The decline was due mainly to lower average revenue-per-day filled from a mixed shift away from specialties like radiology and surgery which typically have the highest daily bill rates. These impairment charges resulted from a combination of continued decrease in the company's market value and lower projected growth rates which reflected the decline in Nurse and Allied orders that began late in 2008 and then rapidly deteriorated during the first quarter of 2009. Allied orders have begun experiencing an upward trend for the past two months and we anticipate allied volume to be flat or slightly up on a sequential basis. DSO improved by three days to 54 days and the company continues to focus on its collection efforts to drive strong cash flow. However because of the lag time between receiving an order and starting an assignment, we anticipate that travel-nurse volumes will be down double-digits sequentially in the second quarter. Going into the second quarter, nursing order levels have begun to stabilize. These reductions in SG&A expenses demonstrate management's ability to quickly and effectively implement cost reduction measures in response to expected lower revenue and volumes, while increasing efficiency, and creating a more streamlined organization. As a result, we have seen a significant increase in our preferred client relationships, where we receive the lead time on our orders. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. The company continues to generate strong operating cash flow, a hallmark of our differentiated business model. We have also been successful in maintaining and growing our physician as a preferred provider with clinicians. In addition to focusing on daily execution, we are also dedicating resources to areas that will fuel our future growth. If you look at the last two market contractions where you might have seen quarterly fluctuations in market share, most companies ended up with comparable overall volume contraction by the end of the cycle. The relative strength of our diversified client base and our consistent focus on quality is becoming even more evident in this tight market environment. Also, by reducing work schedules, we have been able to preserve our employee talent pool so that we can quickly flex back upward once the market reaches an inflection point. We've been able to grow our market share over the prior year, and at the same time continue to proactively maintain investments in our future to support our new service lines. Although pricing was up in most specialties, revenue per day filled was down 1.5% year-over-year primarily due to mixed shift away from our highest bill rate group of radiology. Overall our days filled volume was relatively flat for the quarter. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and our current reports on Form 8-K which have been filed and publicly available from the SEC.","I think it's too difficult to call exactly which month the stabilization and traveler count will occur and get back to that lag effect between orders translating into bookings. And probably most importantly, manage it at the front end with your referencing and your quality control in deciding which positions you choose to work with. Albert J. William Rice Soleil Securities Corporation You've got obviously some good cash flow out of your working capital and on the Cross Country report yesterday, and they had obviously seen a similar thing. Its just that your bottoming out at a low level of orders. It takes one to two quarters to really see the effect of that demand flow through to your bookings in your traveler count. Is that what we're calling stabilization or are we talking about somehow a rebound where year-over-year trends are all of a sudden more comparable and so forth. So it's -- I think -- and you've got to remember in the second quarter we saw a decline in traveler count from April where would expect to see -- from the decline in orders in the first part of the first quarter -- you would expect to see the second quarter falloff through the quarter as opposed to be a straight line. That it would take a little bit longer than that to actually flow through to your traveler count. Is the stability in orders been very recent and do you expect that to continue throughout the year? Albert J. William Rice Soleil Securities Corporation So do most of the hospitals that you would have a relationship with today are not outsourcing they're contracting their emergency medical staff, or as a general rule today? Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director It's still a minority of hospitals that are outsourcing those functions. And so if we -- I mean if you sort of extrapolate that out -- if we've seen stabilization in orders now for the last one to two months, you would expect that you wouldn't see the bottom in the second quarter."

At the same time, our clinical labor supply is aging and will begin to retire. From an operational perspective, we are poised to leverage our infrastructure and productivity capacity as the market rebounds. This quarterly stability marks an important inflection point for us in the economic cycle. Nurse and Allied segment SG&A was lower, reflecting the efforts taken to reduce ongoing operational costs. As we look to the second quarter and beyond, we see margins holding steady with potential for some improvement due to continued reductions in the cost of health benefits and from changes in how we reimburse travelers for meals and incidentals. Given these short-term and long-term dynamics, we remain focused on the key components of our long- term strategic plan. The internal issues I mentioned arose from significant restructuring we did in 2009, creating a temporary disruption in the business and the productivity of our teams. In the meantime, we will remain lean to deliver solid operating profits at these lower-volume levels and ensure that we are taking necessary steps to be prepared for the opportunities for the future. Overall, our first quarter results were representative of the stabilization being experienced across the healthcare staffing industry, as well as the improved operational and sales execution of our team. Despite the improving trends across the business segments, overall demand is still at relatively low levels and constrained by high national unemployment and stagnant admission levels. As the business rebounds, we expect expenses will increase at a faster pace than revenues in the short term. To maximize fill rates with our active searches, we are continuing to increase our recruiter headcount. The significant efforts we undertook to restructure and streamline our operations and build stronger client relationships in 2009 are paying off and are evident in our profitability and margins. While revenue declined 3% on our Locum Tenens segment, days filled and gross margin held steady sequentially at about 43,000 and 26.2%, respectively. Unallocated overhead in the first quarter was $5.7 million, as compared to $6.1 million in the prior year and $5.4 million in the prior quarter. This growing shortage will be further compounded by the limited capacity of our physician residency programs and nursing schools to produce new clinicians at the same pace. As we are all aware, throughout last year, the company took significant steps to rightsize the organization and improve the overall operating structure of the company in order to achieve sustained efficiencies. The decline in operating income in this segment is slightly lower than the revenue decline we saw, due in large part to the cost of revenue decreasing at a faster pace than revenue, mainly from lower labor costs. While demand for nurse travelers continues to be higher on a year-over-year basis, the orders are still at very low historic levels. There is no doubt in my mind that as the economy returns to more normal level of general unemployment, we will begin to see the gap between demand and supply of clinical labor widened significantly. The market is still very tight and continues to be constricted by high general unemployment and stagnant patient-admission levels. Third, our efforts to streamline and consolidate our operational and cost infrastructure, not only improve our operating leverage, but have created a more agile organization to support product development and other growth initiatives. The improvement was a result of higher order levels during the first part of the fourth quarter and continued improvements in our fill rates and retention rates. These may include initiatives to expand on our current core capabilities or diversify into strategic market adjacencies that further differentiate the company. In the first quarter, the Nurse and Allied business generated $75 million in revenues, which was up 2% sequentially. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and other periodic reports, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Despite the constricted environment, our nurses on assignment are working more hours per day. I'll kick off the call first with a discussion on our business trends and some of the first quarter sales and operational highlights. These larger search opportunities provide excellent long-term revenue opportunity, however, they take longer to fully convert as these clients often prefer to stage the recruitment and hiring process. The increase as compared to prior quarter is due to our reflecting the cost of unused space in our leased facilities in unallocated overhead. Demand for rehab therapists remains strong, but the availability of the supply of clinicians is limited. For the first quarter, we generated $11.7 million of operating cash flow, of which about $1.4 million went to reduced debt.","I mentioned our higher fill rates and the higher retention rates and that can really be attributed to two things. One, the number of preferred accounts and vendor management accounts that we have, where we do have a preference or lead time on the orders and that certainly helps us increase our fill rates. More I'm talking about on the Nurse and Allied side and Locum side, and also, as we start to see more effort towards vendor management solutions and us providing those, we're building up that capability. Our orders, I mentioned, were up in Nurse and Allied on a year-over-year basis, but you'll qualify that and say they're still relatively low in terms of what we need to drive more significant growth. But also, if you look at our total orders, not only our orders up on a year-over-year basis but the number of facilities that have ordered is up pretty considerably, almost double on a year-over-year basis. Having more of those preferred and VM clients, again, better fill rates, better retention rates. I was just curious, are you starting to see the higher travel costs lean on margins at all on a meaningful way? So that's certainly contributed to our better fill rates. And those orders were for placements in the December, January, February time frame. Bary G. Bailey Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer As we start to see the business coming back, looking at primarily in the labor side, recruiting, as we start seeing it rebound, we have some room in our existing recruiting certainly, but we don't want to get caught running into a supply limitation as the demand starts to increase. So even with minimal marketing expense at these demand levels, as you can expect, there's not a lot being spent on the kind of a supply recruitment. I think you heard us talk on our third quarter call and even again on our last call, that we saw a sort of a height in orders around October and November. Did that impact your business at all either in terms of orders or in terms of actually the people out in the field for the first quarter? But in Allied, we did continue to make some changes in our processes, in our branding, moving our teams around, and that continued to bid into the fourth quarter which has affected their volumes. As you can expect when demand is low, we work harder to find ways that we can improve our processes and efficiency in getting our candidates in front of clients first and really present their skills in the best light. Part of that increase was driven by the stronger order volumes we had at the beginning of the fourth quarter. As I mentioned, our fill rates are better with those preferred and VM clients across the board. And then, we saw orders fall off in December and January. Incorporated, Research Division So how should we think about the excess capacity or the incremental margins going forward if things do improve this year and the next year unfolds? And certainly, we're going to continue, as Susan mentioned in her script, run lean."

It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and other periodic reports, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. There are no material changes to the annual financial estimates we provided last quarter for depreciation, amortization, interests, expense, share count or capital expenditures. In April, client facilities with orders were up over 20% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. This was done by leveraging our significant national and local supply of candidates and increasing the direct fill rates on our MSP contracts. We are pleased to see that our supply of new candidates coming into the travel business is growing. Likewise, the travel nurse orders brought over by Medfinders MSP contracts are now primarily being directly filled by leveraging AMN’s large pool of travel professionals. Compared to the prior year, the operating margin declined by 40 basis points due mainly to the addition of Medfinders which carries an overall higher cost of operations for the local per diem staffing business. While we have seen our staffing orders steadily improve throughout the country since last year, our ability to capture incremental market share has been bolstered by the expansion of our managed services program through last year’s acquisition of Medfinders. The growth in orders is also occurring across most geographies, with our top five states spanning the west, northeast, the southeast and the south. Allied staffing revenue is expected to be flat as we stabilize from the disruption of integration activities. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. We had projected to $2 million in annualized EBITDA synergies by the fourth quarter from this MSP direct fill synergy, and I am pleased to report that we are currently ahead of schedule towards achieving this target. In the near term, we have been and are continuing to capitalize on the improving demand as the market rebounds. Excluding this impact, the revenue increased year-over-year by 13% due to the addition of Medfinders, and declined sequentially by 7% on lower hourly billing to direct mail activity. The combination of our national supply and our local offices helps to make us an especially capable partner for our clients who are going through such a conversion. In growing our top-line revenues, we are setting ourselves up to hit our longer term objective of leveraging our operating model in order to achieve 10% adjusted EBITDA margins in the next three to five years. Our MSP orders have been trending approximately 25% of our overall travel nursing demand, and we continue to be very successful in winning new MSP contracts at a pace faster than we anticipated. In fact, order levels in April were twice what they were a year ago. While we are projecting sequential growth, there are certainly headwinds that continue to challenge the home health industry. Our home healthcare segment generated revenue of $13.6 million and operating income of $1 million for the quarter. For both travel and local per diem staffing, supply will become an increasingly important area for us to focus due to the rising demand. On allocated overhead excluding stock compensation integration expenses in the first quarter were $7.7 million, unchanged from the preceding quarter and higher than the prior year expense of $5.7 million. First quarter operating cash flow was $5.6 million, day sales outstanding were 54 days as compared to 54 last quarter and capital expenditures for the first quarter were $1.7 million. We’ll tend to use any excess cash flow generated through the year to pay down debt. As healthcare delivery models transform to address the challenge of providing increased access to health services while maintaining the quality and reducing costs, AMN will offer more sophisticated solutions that can deliver value and efficiencies. Demand is rising at both MSP clients, as well as at our traditional clients, and the overall number of facilities with travel nurse orders continues to move up. This could not have been accomplished without the talent and collaboration shown by our dedicated team members across the entire organization, and we command and thank them all for their great efforts. Travel nurse order levels have continued to increase for well over a year now. The gross margin was sequentially higher by 80 basis points, due in part to a staffing project with a single during the quarter. Whereas before we had to use subcontractors to fill our local per diem orders, we are now able to partially fill that demand directly through our Nursefinders local office network. We have also completed the streamlining of our client and clinical operational functions into our share services model, and the integration of the finance function is complete. This improved pricing will be an important factor in our ability to drive supply, to meet the growing demand, and to offset pressures in housing and bill pay spreads. The local offices continue to be an important ingredient in our success in winning and filling MSP business.","So, that would be the most efficient position or so. So it doesn’t include the fact that we are winning more MSPs and obviously filling those. And that comes from contracts that we already have in place, so it’s not new contracts that have been won since the companies came together, but they were contracts that both AMN and Medfinders already had in place, and our ability to fill more of the travel and per diem orders within those contracts. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director It was actually probably both overtime, it was the obvious timing aspect. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Frank, and just to kind of come back on the supply question because the other piece about is in the local staffing piece. Frank Brown Suntrust Robinson Humphrey And I guess one of your peers kind of described an element the environment going from a demand to a supply driven environment. They’ve done a great job of improving their productivity across fewer sales representatives. Starting Q3, Tobey, our supply began to grow, I mean that momentum has continued to build. We’ve been fortunate and have seen growth in the supply on the travel nursing side, and that’s not surprising since demand has gone up so much, word of mouth is one of the most powerful drivers of supply. Once you get a nurse in, you can repeat that nurse over and over again, you don’t have the orientation costs, you’ve got control over the orders, and you really don’t have any marketing costs to speak of. They’ve improved year-over-year sequentially, but we still haven’t gotten back to that capacity that we were seeing in ’08. We were subcontracting out to affiliate vendors, which still do, a portion because we can’t fill all of the needs even in our most successful MSPs. AJ Rice Susquehanna Financial Group On the cash flow from [ops] in the quarter, you were $5.6 million, very similar to fourth quarter. So we have a fairly regionally based organization, so we can see some ebbs and flows within the market from quarter-to-quarter standpoint. But, fundamentally the reason we think things are going to improve in all four segments is just investments we’ve made in more sales people, more process in terms of how we are getting out of the marketplace and selling our product. We expect to achieve more, but where the real upside is longer term is on the revenue synergies as we continue to build upon those direct fills at the MSP contracts. And it is indicative too of the fact clients realize it, they do have demand and want to attract that quality in there. So, the positive direction and the momentum is good, but we’d still like to see demand continue to pick up, because demand growth is still the greatest driver of supply growth overall. Remember that we have, Frank, is that we are able to really reach into the supply candidate pool across all of our databases which now encompasses travel and per diem, and while they aren’t always or even typically the same nurse, it does give us a very deep and broad pool that we can use to kind of reach out to more and more candidates. That’s one of the reason I think we are seeing in this supply constrained market that we are starting to move into. We’ve got a very strong pipeline on our MSP, but also in the core business, just Ralph has done a great job with his team to help have them add per diem to his contracts and likewise we’ve had some clients where we didn’t have travel added in our contract, so there really is a great deal of cross-selling going on and the clients I think really appreciate the fact that we are now a full service organization who can provide all their needs. So my guess is, we may fair better on the supply front than our peers because of that broader deeper candidate pool and now the ability to cross pollinate and reach across multiple databases. So we have a lot of opportunity to fill growing demand just within the candidate pool that we have, and particularly if you look at the area of growth in orders such as net search, which is a slightly easier area to fill based on the candidate pool. Josh Vogel Sidoti & Company Susan, you talked about aggressive hiring and training within physician perm, but I was curious about additional capacity you had in the other businesses. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director AJ, I think it contributes not only on to the retention of clients, because we are so much more capable to fill a broader section and types of their needs, but also in winning contracts such as MSPs. We do have capacity in the travel nurse business in particular where we have added recruiters, some that came along with the Medfinders acquisition, but we’ve actually even brought back some former recruiters that left us during the downturn. Can you talk a little bit about the supply and is that becoming a big factor yet? It was 54 last quarter and we’d like to keep at that level, and if we can then I think we’ll see our cash flow be relatively consistent for the year. We will be making some investments in supply in the upcoming quarters, but I think right now we are doing a very good job overall on our supply trends. The pricing for that business encompasses the idea that we have an obligation to meet fill rates. They are still not back at productivity levels of 2008. There are some areas where we really are still very much in a demand constraint mode, as much as the demand has grown across all of our segments, particularly in all of our temporary segment and still at a relatively low point compared to historic high. I think the other thing that will help us drive incremental productivity on them is to search in the Medsearch nurses which our database has more of those nurses in them, but this is slightly easier to kind of prudential and fill that other position. So, we do have more of a supply constraint right now, because nurses who were working per diem are probably already working as much as they can work. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director And first to address the perm placements, we do think there is more demand out there that we are not tapping into because we don’t have the sales personnel, primarily on the marketing side out in the field. So we are seeing in pockets of the country, particularly in the west and somewhat in the east that we are really having difficulty filling all of our orders. The productivity of the marketers and recruiters we have in perm placement is terrific. Ralph S. Henderson President of Professional Services & Staffing A couple of things Tobey, first I think we talked about this before, but you know we have a very large database, 75,000 active travel candidates, and we’ve implemented new tools to make them easier to reach like voice blast and text messaging, and things like that which is more efficient for our recruiters and for the nurses as well who like those tools. And historically, under the old guidance or the old field standards, we were required to basically bundle those together and run them through a deferred revenue model, and so we had always a deferred revenue balance in our order balance sheet, other than new standards, we were able to take certain services within that physician perm and not defer them anymore. And so, we don’t have the same benefit I think on a supply side in certain markets than we might as travelers, because we can go into our database and get travelers to reunite, travel again where as on the per diem side it’s a little tougher. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Our revenue projection for the second quarter is up, so I think from that alone if you kind of do the math, it would not imply reduction in EPS. AJ Rice Susquehanna Financial Group On the Medfinders, you sort of been through the first cycle of placements under the AMN banner, and any comment on retention rate of people rolling over with you. You kind of get a viral effect as more and more nurses are out there travelling in more facilities and they are talking to other nurses out in the field."

Another contributor has been our increase investment in social and mobile media to reach out in a track a greater supply of physician candidate. The lower debt interest rate will result in cash interest savings of approximately $1 million per quarter into 2014, and for the foreseeable future we intend to continue applying our excess free cash flow to pay down our debt balance. We also continue to experience increased interest from our client for other strategic workforce solutions such as recruitment process outsourcing, EMR staffing, and workforce consulting projects. We continue to focus on building our team, our marketers and recruiters to ensure that we are able to achieve the high fill rates on our active searches. It requires minimum annual payments of 1% of the initial principle balance and a standard require access cash flow payment due annually, which starts at 50%. This was due primarily to improved bill rates and bill pay spreads resulting from the pricing and margin management process changes that we put into place at the end of last year. These forces of strong demand and lagging supply of clinicians in almost every discipline, is expected to ramp up significantly in 2014 and beyond. A locum tenens segment revenue decreased by 1.6% from the prior quarter reflecting a 3.4% decrease in days filled and a 1.8% increase revenue per day filled. Until that time to ensure we retain our competitive advantage as a recruitment powerhouse, we will continue to make internal investments in our social media, mobile and online technologies. Another big differentiator is our ability to quickly recruit for and fulfilled our client's demand for quality clinicians, especially as the industry continues to rebound. While our orders were softer at the beginning of the year, our team was able to maximize our opportunity with a very strong fill rates during the fourth quarter and the first quarter producing a very healthy sequential and year-over-year volume increase. The sequential growth was driven by strong fill rates high rebook rates and increased nurse applicants. First quarter revenue from continuing operations was $226.4 million, up 5% from last year and 2% from last quarter. In April, we also refinanced our credit agreement, which provides a lower cost of debt and created operating flexibility in the future. We gained significant market share during 2011 due to our strength in MSP offering and our ability to deliver to our clients through higher fill rates. Going into the second quarter, allied order has continued to improve and volume is expected to be up again sequentially and year-over-year. On a GAAP basis we reported first quarter pre-tax income from continuing operation to $6.8 million. The Allied team has delivered significant improvement in our sales productivity, margin management, and SG&A management. It's uncertain whether healthcare will reach these high levels, but with estimates of our industry currently at 10% to 20% MSP utilization that certainly appears to be significantly more growth opportunity. We expect that SG&A to increase somewhat in the second quarter to drive support growth in the business and the additional supply driven investments that Susan mentioned earlier. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $9.6 million and capital expenditures for the first quarter were $1 million. Even though we will continue to leverage technology, we also know that we must maintain a personalized and streamline experience for our clients and clinicians. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and our other filings with the SEC which are publicly available. And just like nursing the Allied fill rate are improving significantly and contributing to higher client satisfaction and the ability to win more new business due to our reputation for delivering results. Both facilities have an interest rate and excess cash flow step downs based on the company's financial leverage. Currently about a third of our Nurse and Allied segment revenues are generated from MSP contracts. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, should, would, project may variations of the such words and other similar expressions. According to a recently release staffing industry analyst report MSP usage by large buyers of contingent labor and other industries ranges between 50 and 70%. Regarding our policy on forward-looking statements, various remarks and characterizations we make during this call about future expectations, projections, plans, prospects, events or circumstances constitute forward-looking statements. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 7% for the first quarter which compares with the 4% in both the prior year and prior quarter.","I would agree that there's always a focus and I continue to have a focus on cost cutting and cost controls I think as we all know this the healthcare reforms has, provide so much uncertainty still that some of the decisions that are being made are just to procrastinate. Another thing I know we didn't get to talk about but that Susan had talked about some investments in our advertising and marketing and some things, we don't want to share some of it, because it's - there are some things that we're doing that are competitive in nature but we are - we are streamlining the process to bring applicants in the door and we're making and some of the SG&A investments that we're making are to fund those initiatives, you know, things like your mobile devices are being enable so that nurses can access jobs more readily I think you may have seen a couple of announcements we made about that. A couple of other positive things, 8 to 9 weeks really of steady growth and there are a couple other positive things about our orders right now. And one of the ways that they look for doing things as doing what they're already doing maybe a little bit more efficiently. And so I think if we look at our order base and our travel account today it's an even healthier dispersion across the country. The last point was on the fill rates because our fill rates on MSPs have always been higher and they actually grew throughout the quarter. I think I mentioned that in the March call where we've seen some declines in orders at that time. And so they can be much more efficient with a time which is why our productivity of recruiters is at the highest it has been in a couple of years and has been up year-over-year now for quite a while. I think our MSP program, and RPO programs and everything else just kind of take a - hit a sweet spot with them in terms of just identifying where they're already spending money that they could be doing it more efficiently. I will say that a team has done a very good job over the last year, in particular controlling some of those kind of site factors such as vacancy, which is actually down on a year-over-year basis for the first time in a while, but rents continue to inch up across the country at 5% to 10%. I think our additional supply, applied new applicants being up year-over-year, quarter over quarter also helps that, but as a recruiter is submitting applicants out for different job opportunities, they know their profitability of placement is much greater at an MSP client. It's really evenly distributed between East and West which usually bodes well for us. But if you look at the order base today, it's actually roughly split half and half between the east and the west. Not necessarily at a lower rate you know per hour, because quality is so important to them and patient safety and re-hospitalization and readmission is actually a big driver towards them, wanted to add enough labor, whether that's their permanent labor or our contract labor, to make sure that they are positioned for this readmission and patient safety incentives that are going to come forth, coming down the line. And with regards to the nurse behavior, what are you seeing from that perspective are you doing anything more than being more efficient, in terms of getting orders filled? And in terms of the capacity that you have with the recruiters you said that they're in your multi- year highs and in terms of the productivity, do they still have more room to go? Having fewer orders we were able to still grow the business which is something we have been talking I know about for several quarters that we thought during any kind of economic downturn, any slowdown in orders. We think that one of the reasons, our travelers come to us as we have a broader more attractive selection of assignments and you need to have orders in all parts of the country. And we think that's very reflective of what we're hearing from our clients that they're seeing their clinicians, nurses in particular more empowered more emboldened to move on. So throughout the quarter then orders began to climb and from mid February where we are at today orders were up about 50% which is great. So we did see order drop. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Yes, recruiter productivity, is up like 15% on a year-over-year basis. We talked about some of these supply driven initiatives that we have as we start to work through those. I was wondering could you talk a little bit about your comments around the fill rates, because it sounded like the orders early in the quarter went down, but the fill rates went up and that helped to power things through. And the last point on orders is that about one out of 5 clients that have an order right now is a client that actually hasn't ordered from us within the last 2 years. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director I think to just really reflect the efficiency and productivity of the MSP model and I also want to make sure that everyone of those are-- fill rates have improved at our traditional accounts as well and our traditional clients. So we've seen less pricing pressure and actually more efficiency gains that we've been able to try to talk about with our clients. So just across the board the team is doing a terrific job of creating efficiency and improving fill rates. And then other things, kind of technology wise so again we think that will drive recruiter productivity, we think it will actually make our marketing dollars more efficient at the same time and they'll help us grow the business faster than we would have been able to under kind of - with our current technology and current processes. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Probably the most notable change has been in the Travel Nurse orders over the last year where we've always had strong orders and stronger orders in the west."

In addition to the benefits of MSP wins from 2012, we’ve continued to add more new clients in 2013 and are very excited about the pipeline and potential new contracts we should close over the remaining of the year. We also experienced an above normal flu season during January and February which contributed to higher orders and travellers on assignment. The second is the continued differentiation and expansion of our suite of workforce solutions, and the third is streamlining our technology infrastructure for greater efficiency, scalability and agility. It’s clear that healthcare organizations are seeking innovative ways to better manage their labor costs and ensure access to high quality clinicians when they are needed. Our tax rate in the quarter was 43%, which was in line with our guidance, based on our current projections, we expect the same 43% rate for the second quarter and for the full year 2013. Since our fill rates for MSP clients are higher than those in traditional clients, we were able to grow faster during periods of market expansion and it provides some protection during periods of demand softness. Cash used in operations for the quarter was 2.7 million driven by growth in working capital from higher revenues and increase in DSO. Although the EMR pipeline is strong for the second quarter it is unlikely to hit the peak level we experienced during the first quarter. The year over year improvement was driven by increased search activity and increased placements. As hospitals determine how they will meet this patient care demand in the midst of worsening labor shortage, they are increasingly adopting workforce solutions that provide cost benefits while enabling access to quality commissions. We do anticipate DSO will decline in the second quarter and expect positive operating cash flow for the remainder of 2013. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, should, would, project, may, variations of such words and other similar expressions. In addition, there was some order fall-off due to the completion of a couple of large EMR projects in the first quarter. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and our other filings with the SEC, which are publicly available. However our non-MSP orders have declined sequentially due to a decline in winter seasonal demand and flu orders. Going into the second quarter our MSP travel nurse orders have stayed relatively steady since the beginning of the year. Nurse and allied staffing revenue was up 15% year over year and 1% sequentially, the largest contributor to growth was the higher volume in the travel nurse business which was driven in part due to year over year increases in orders, clients with orders and clients with clinicians on assignment and upside surprise was the exceptionally strong revenue from EMI engagements during the first quarter. Despite a decline in therapy orders driven by reimbursement cuts, therapy volumes were still slightly up year over year due to stronger fill rates and growth in our allied and MSP clients. Before I hand it off to Brian I would like to take a moment to thank our very talented team for the solid execution and passion for delivering excellence and quality to our clients and clinicians every day. Regarding our policy on forward-looking statements, various remarks and characterizations we make during this call about future expectations, projections, plans, prospects, events or circumstances constitute forward-looking statements. Gross margin improved by 310 basis points from the prior year due to improved sales productivity but was down by 260 basis points from the prior quarter due mainly to the prior quarter reduction to our sales reserve. The first is our digital transformation initiative to aggressively attract more clinician supply through innovative recruitment technologies, job distribution platform and mobile applications.","Gary Paul Taylor Citigroup Inc, Research Division And in your prepared comments, you suggested non-MSP FTEs would be down sequentially MSP orders steady. But we are also in the midst of improving some of our back office systems in order to better connect our sales teams, reduce redundancies that we have manual processes that we have throughout the company which add costs and also make it challenging to deliver service in an accurate and timely fashion. And so you see a very quick kind of reaction to temporary labor, it happens, seems like every single year, and we did see a little bit of that as well. So far we have had to reinvest it in other cost of sales primarily in physician compensation, in order to find our way into some of these specialties where we weren’t very large before. We think we can help clients who want to try to control those costs but yet pick up substantially more volumes for ourselves. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director If anything, we think of that access to supply the willingness of clinicians to leave a permanent job and coming into the travel industry might be increasing, we are certainly seeing increased applications that I mentioned the career builder survey that came out just a couple of days ago and they talked about the burn out of healthcare workers and how 1/3 are going to be looking for a job this year, half are going to be looking for a job change in the next year. So I think that’s one reason we have seen steady orders in the MSP clients since the beginning of the year. In our case we always had the philosophy that efficiency really pays off. From the non-MSP clients so that would be traditional competitive accounts and third party accounts, so those would be VMS types of relationships through vendor neutral, more technology related types of providers, we’ve actually seen the orders come down. Again as Susan mentioned earlier, little bit of step up in our capital expenditures this year, so when we look at the free cash flow, that will be our strategy to continue to delever the balance sheet. And they are usually there at the table competing for the business but we feel some stronger momentum from some of these vendor neutral companies that are out there and some clients want to go that route rather than a full service MSP. And so that’s allowed us to take the door increases that we have seen and investment them back into attracting more supply. Just one more thing, there was this great report put out by the advisory board that talked about bending the labor curve and they talked about how taking short term Capex and cost cutting on your labor force and particularly your clinical labor force, will have only a temporary relief and it’s not a sustainable strategy. Those aren’t necessarily region, it’s just more project driven, and then we had higher flu related business and those orders -- our largest order state were from California, Texas, Northeast, probably more population driven than anything. With regards to the recruiting efforts, what are you seeing in terms of fill rate and behavior in terms of willingness to take traveler assignments. Robert E. Livonius Former President of Strategic Workforce Solutions - AMN Healthcare There are business surveys that are out there, that staffing industry analysts have done to try to test the waters and you get ranges from 30% to 40% of the -- hospital systems have some form of an automated approach to their contract labor may be VMS or MSP. I think we are not concerned about supply right now as something that would be a barrier to accelerated growth. And one of our other publicly traded competitors talks about being in the locums business, so that’s actually a good thing, it's a milestone I think when we 2 or 3 competitors touting being in the locums, there are certainly VMS companies who have expanded their capabilities to do that so when you move from a concepts sill which is where we are today and our current window of opportunity is really to sell in that in concept sell environment. In locums MSP we talked about this on prior calls but it’s a very efficient delivery methodology, you don’t have to compete. They actually had a 2 point improvement in our locums business and their fill rates recently. And certainly we can look at market growth from our orders and sales and when we have an MSP relationship and see the orders growing or not growing and that’s a good sense of what’s happening in the market itself, although you have to remember that MSP clients are more often the larger the more sophisticated clients and they tend to be more strategic users of temporary staff, they don’t make us many kneejerk reaction changes to their staffing plans. So we have been doing that over the last year, the last year has been more about the digital transformation project which is the improvements in our website, our mobile media, job distribution, those types of things and we are continuing to be rolling those out over the next year. It’s actually good for us in the sense that drives attention to contract labor more broadly and since we can do the IT spend it seems to be more positive for us to help rope that all in under one platform or under one program. So if you look at the SG&A projection it’s more than - that’s why we give that range. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Yes, it might be a little too specific although I kind of mentioned that the MSP clients tend to be more steady and really use travelers and local staffing kind of strategically as part of their ongoing workforce planning. Your fill rates go up, you have more time to book housing. Our fill rate themselves have trended up, our MSP fill rates which we discussed are thus almost at an all time highs and our traditional fill rates have been very solid as well. Robert E. Livonius Former President of Strategic Workforce Solutions - AMN Healthcare I think, Susan, to your point I think there the competition is broader than just one company that’s out there, certainly there are couple companies, Quasi MSP and pure vendor neutral space and we certainly prospect all of our competitors but we are doing very well in the market and our pipeline in MSP is just about as robust as ever been. We also had I think a tremendous success from the recruitment side when we restructured the organization to focus on specialties, the teams really became I think just better at filling jobs within their specialty. It’s a lot of efficiencies are driven in the back office and the sales organization when the client is on MSP program versus working in a traditional environment where you’re slugging it out with 7, 8 competitors on a single order. So do you feel like your MSP clients have a lower order book sequentially but you are still gaining share or are we just getting too specific in a given quarter to think about that? Ralph S. Henderson President of Professional Services & Staffing I would add one more thing, this is Ralph, on California we have several clients who use travel nurses to fill in big seasonal jump that they have, where they typically refer to as their winter needs. And that’s where the team has really done a great job there in Texas in helping to grow our new producers, new marketers and recruiters and get them productive more quickly. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer We continue to see a really good pipeline of opportunities, it’s still small overall in relation to the segment that it has. You would expect our pipeline to be bigger and it certainly is. So we are finding that they are great clients and great prospective MSP clients particularly for your larger national and regional firms that are trying to get their arms around their workforce planning and their workforce spend. And so as I mentioned we’ve actually seen pretty good steady order growth and kind of order flow from those MSP clients since the first of the year. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director As you recall we talked a year ago about some particular strategic initiatives that we were going to be increasing our spending because we wanted everyone to know that we were going to increase our SG&A and CapEx spending in order to help ensure that we would get those growth opportunities as well as gain better efficiencies in our back office through system improvements, process changes etc. I am just trying to get a sense for what it might be on the other side of the coin that really is business that you can’t help your customers fill on that side? Incorporated, Research Division And then lastly in your opening comments you referenced the softness in the census we heard from some of the hospital companies, as it relates to the quarter but then with the indication that April picked up again, are you seeing that in your order flow? Ralph S. Henderson President of Professional Services & Staffing In the process of implementing a fixed brand new locums deal, and none of them actually - they are kind of approaching go live day, or they have been recently. And so again the pipeline going forward still looks some very good but we don’t expect that the second quarter to be quite a strong as the first quarter. Joshua David Vogel Sidoti & Company, LLC I guess a follow up on the line of questioning on the MSP before, I just wonder if you could - we are seeing obviously this business growing at a healthy clip, I was just curious how big this market is and the opportunity for you, what percent of healthcare systems are currently not sourcing through your competitors? As we look at our overall orders, it’s actually still a very good distribution, between kind of east and west if you cut the country down the middle and the trends haven’t changed that much between the 2. The team has done a phenomenal job of holding housing costs in check. They refer to wholesale labor cuts as causing harm to the workforce stability and quality of care and in fact, I guess there was a study that was put out by the HMA that summed that hospitals, the healthcare systems that had across the board cuts were nearly twice as likely to experience increases in patient mortality and it's no surprise. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director In order to grow the top line in that business you have to be hiring new grade talent, new marketers, new recruiters and you have got to have a good training program and a cohort in place to be putting them out into the market and increasing your capacity. But I think you have seen more stability in those orders generally over time. Yes, we will continue to take our free cash flow."

Revenue for healthcare professional working increased 4%, reflecting the relatively healthy demand for quality clinicians. Days filled volume overall for the locum tenens business increased 10% sequentially. In addition to our focus on efficiency and daily execution, we are also continuing to make investments in some of our newer, faster-growing services to continue to drive new revenue channels. For the full year 2008, we continue to project an income tax rate of approximately 41%. There is certainly strong demand in other attractive regions such as the northwest and central states and our recruitment and account management teams are doing a great job in directing our candidates supply to where it is needed most. Days filled volume for the quarter rose 10% sequentially, reflecting an important gain in momentum for this division. We expect to be able to direct our supply accordingly and continue to grow nurse volumes in revenues, albeit at a modest level throughout the remainder of the year. Some of these initiatives will are generate revenue in 2008 but most are expected to drive incremental revenue in 2009 and beyond. In order to continue to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, we entered into a number of new LIBOR swap agreements this quarter. At the other end of the spectrum, some historically strong states such as Florida and Arizona are down in orders. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements. We generated 12 million of cash flow from operations during the second quarter which, when combined with $8 million of cash on hand, revolver drawdowns were used primarily to pay estimated taxes, partially settle an acquisition hold back reserve and fund the stock repurchases. As I mentioned earlier, we have several initiatives focused on further diversifying our product lines and broadening our client base in order to increase our growth opportunities. Based on trends, experienced in July, along with seasonal patterns expected to pick up during the third and fourth quarters, we reaffirm our projected diluted earnings per share growth of 11% to 16% or $1.16 to $1.22. Looking to the second half of the year, we will continue to carefully manage SG&A expenses in relation to gross profit in order to achieve our full year earnings expectation. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Since the beginning of the year, we have reallocated resources from imaging to therapy and other new specialties like lab technician in order to maximize the growth of this group long-term. We have seen the greatest increases in the West with California leading the way with orders up double digits year-over-year. This expense is comprised of $2.5 million in depreciation and $1.2 million in amortization, compared to the same quarter last year, depreciation increased by $500,000 due mainly to internally developed Software projects placed in service in late 2007. We are also narrowing our projected revenue growth for the full year to 6% to 8% or 1.23 billion to 1.26 billion. Compared to last quarter, the higher locum tenens revenue was due to growth and days filled, particularly in our primary care and behavioral health divisions. All other specialties experienced sequential growth in pricing, a good reflection of a continued, healthy demand environment and our ability to sell our value as a high quality physician provider. We believe that our strategy to have more orders in more diverse locations and low customer concentration is benefiting us during this type of market.","So, we are constantly looking for those kinds of investments to increase our productivity and operational efficiency. Susan Nowakowski They are now also finding themselves in a position of shortages and also, as you see more regional and national players emerge through consolidation, it provides more opportunity to serve those markets in a more efficient manner. It really is the continued investment and focus and our team really looking for those operating efficiencies, you know. Susan Nowakowski I think it is always a constraint. Did you find supply of candidates to be a constraint to your growth this quarter? Helps to maybe mitigate risk of some of the patient load that might shift from the acute care setting to those settings over time or from the physician's office to those settings but also gives us another work environment to offer to our healthcare professionals and we believe that is been a real part of our draw is being able to offer our clinicians a very broad, diverse set of work assignments and this just adds to the continuation of that strategy. Susan Nowakowski Well, we are seeing efficiency gains throughout the company, specific investments that we have made and it is not one big bullet or one big project that is creating these. Just want to get an order of magnitude of how much that impacted you in the quarter? Is it more efficiently delivering the services you currently offer? I think based on our current demand and the current pricing we are seeing and the 3% to 5% range to maintain stable margins is probably, for us, our best strategy. One in particular is in the emergency department segment and if you look at a lot of the hospitals that are reporting performance, most all of them are talking about emergency rooms being up in terms of admissions and activity. That is our largest component of new travelers on assignment. We can always use more supply to fill that demand. It will absolutely be continuing to invest in these new areas and we certainly do not have the revenue and margin generation yet to fully cover them or at least not at the normal EBITDA levels. So, what you have also seen is a little bit of a mix change in our revenue per day filled, which has been hit a little bit harder because radiology has historically had the highest bill rates within the locum segment. You know, we have also realigned our teams internally and because of that, I think they are working more closely and in a more efficient collaborative manner and that has helped as well. That is not all just new supply, actually the percentage that is brand new applicants, as a mix is down a little bit but what is up are individuals that have applied with us in the past. I want to follow-up, I think on some of Michele's line of questioning about dynamics on the supply front. One example, if you are look for an example is that we and this is not just specific to a particular quarter but on a go-forward basis, we have recently implemented a new document imaging system which will not only help us to more efficiently deliver our documents to our clients and help, it will more so even help us internally in the distribution of paper and by the way, it is a nice, green project which our employees love. One of the dynamics that we have seen is while volumes have come down, more so, the pricing has had to come down in order to help generate and support the demand that is out there. It actually has a lower per day filled because these have very high bill rates historically."

Further contributing to lower staffing demand is the challenge facilities are facing in accessing traditional cash flow and capital sources. During the quarter, we have further streamlined our business models through additional moves to consolidate facilities and centralize brand and back-office operations, which will improve our profitability and better leverage our infrastructure in the future. Despite the market-driven declines in revenue, we have capped a steadfast strategic focus on staying close to our current clients, but we're also investing resources in pursuing new service offerings such as recruitment process outsourcing, and dentistry, emergency management and home health staffing. Any statement that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. In response to the market environment, we have placed a renewed emphasis on sales training regarding the marketing and client education process. Bary brings nearly 30 years of experience in finance and operations in healthcare, insurance and pharmaceuticals industries. In order to serve the growing aging population and the expected increase in patient flow due to healthcare reform, hospitals still believe it is critical to stay focused on physician recruitment and long-term expansion of clinical services. Additionally, fill rates continue to be at higher levels over last year across all of our specialties. Not only does this help us in generating demand and placements now, but it set us up to grow faster as the market returns by having these strategic relationships already established. This is clearly than our pattern during the last two periods of market rebound. While we are certainly not happy with these numbers, we do believe that the strength of our relationships across our broad and diverse client base and our focus on delivering noticeably differentiated service and quality will enable us to grow more quickly as the market recovers. Although pricing was up in most specialties, revenue per days filled was flat year-over-year, due primarily to a mix shift away from our highest bill-rate group of Radiology, as well as some of internal medicine sub-specialties. First, continuing to leverage the advantages of our industry-leading position, our strong sales force and diverse client base, and aggressively pursuing preferred provider relationships; second, our focus and progress in growing new service offerings; third, our disciplined approach to improving our cost structure to deliver consistent profitability margins, and better leveraging the company's operating model as the market rebounds; and fourth, the prudent management of our balance sheet and significant reduction in debt, which positions us to invest in future market expansion that will drive long-term growth, and contribute strategic synergies to our core service lines. As previously mentioned, the primary difference in our 2009 projected tax rate as compared to the statutory tax rate is the impact of permanent differences associated with the restructuring and asset impairments recorded in the first quarter. The decline was driven primarily by a decrease in placement volume and pricing from lower overall demand in new retained search activity. Another short-term complication affecting the supply of candidates has been the current housing market, which has made physicians less willing to relocate. With the stabilization in order since April and the trailing off of assignments, we expect to now see traveler count volume bottom out during the third quarter. During the second quarter, we generated 36 million of operating cash flow, which was used primarily to pay down debt. Amy has been with AMN for over seven years and has held various roles within the company, giving her deep knowledge about both the industry, as well as our operations. In addition to focusing on daily execution, we have also dedicated resources to new areas that will fuel our future growth in the physician market. However, this is not yet translated into a material improvement in temporary staffing demand. Our industry-leading position has also helped increase our share of the travel nurse supply. The current market environment of low demand and vendor rationalization trends has enabled us to leverage our strengths as the industry leader, and position AMN as the preferred provider and master vendor supplier, particularly, as small competitors grapple with performance and cash flow issues. First, we continue to be focused on maintaining and building stronger client relationships, and we are aggressively pursuing preferred provider and vendor management contracts; second, we have made significant progress in our new market expansion initiatives to further diversify our service lines; third, we continue to streamline our operational cost structure to deliver consistent operating margins and improve our margins and profitability as the market resumes growth; and fourth, we have strengthened our balance sheet by paying down our debt and increasing cash, putting us in a strong position to take advantage of future market expansion opportunities. It's not surprising that healthcare professional prefer working with a company that has more orders and financial stability, particularly, during these uncertain economic times. The company continues to generate strong operating cash flow, which was assisted by significant reductions in accounts receivable. Some competitors have been eliminating their field sales staff. As a result of continued focus on operating efficiency, we expect our SG&A spending levels to continue to decline through the third quarter and stabilize in the fourth quarter. The sequential change reflects an updated projection of a smaller full-year net loss than previously estimated, which requires booking tax at a higher rate to true up the difference. No other company in our industry has increased their service-offering reach to the same extent, and what's more notable is that we've been able to make these investments while maintaining consistent levels of operating margins. Backing out the insurance benefits would've yield a 7.4% adjusted EBITDA margin, 2.3 percentage points higher than prior year and prior quarter. Our client satisfaction levels are up year- over-year, and we are experiencing important wins from our aggressive pursuit of preferred provider relationships that gives us lead time or exclusivity on orders. Our full year 2009 effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 28%. I know I speak for the entire management team and our board when I say, ""Thank you,"" to our talented team members for maintaining such an unwavering resolve, and having the courage to execute rapidly on critical changes during this unprecedented time in our market. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report of Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and other quarterly and periodic reports which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. The year-over-year decline was due almost entirely to lower volume, as revenue per days filled remained generally stable. Pricing continues to be stable across most of our business lines, helping to maintain growth margins. However, in order to lower their costs, some are attempting to hire physicians more directly through their own internal recruitment efforts. Going into the third quarter, Nursing and Allied order levels are still significantly lower than prior year, but are showing signs of improvement. Overall, our days filled volume for the quarter was down 5% over prior year and was up 4% sequentially. If we can provide them with better information on how the future increase in patients flow will affect them, we can opt and help them to make a more educated and timely hiring decision. Our ability to remain agile and execute well in the short-term, while keeping an eye on nurturing our new service lines, will allow us to emerge from this economic cycle as a stronger leader and better positioned to capitalize on new market opportunities.","The relationships and strong quality in service reputation that we have built from the last 25 years with our hospital clientèle. So we're pretty optimistic about our ability to actually convert that increased order volume. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director It is still our largest market within Nursing and overall, and in fact some of the more recent momentum that we've seen in orders have come from California, so we consider that to be a good thing because they're at clients that we happen to be particularly strong with. What we're being told from our insurance brokers is that all companies are seeing the increase in the claims, as people might be losing their jobs and we're contemplating that, and there's actual been sort of an uptick in the utilization, so we don't expect that to really continue going forward. Vacancy has been pretty stable for us, and so that helps contribute to the efficiency of our housing. And I'm just wondering what the thought process was behind that. As much as we've enjoyed having those remote offices, we did find that it was more challenging to manage, and the productivity levels weren't as strong as those in San Diego. Your outlook for the 15% sequential decline and kind of -- your comments about skewed towards nursing does indicate a little bit of a higher decline than some of the competitors are at least projecting. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Yes, I think it's a little bit early to be giving those projections. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Normal might be, we'll start to see a rise in our winter orders in kind of the September timeframe. Frank Atkins BMO Capital Market And looking at the Allied side, are you still seeing the same trends in decline in imaging, and the strings in rehab, laboratory work? Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director And A.J., those favorable trends are a result of our own claim activity and favorable trends that we've seen there, but also general national market trends where actuarial rates have been adjusted over the last few months, and that affects their estimates for our process as well. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director We did announce on our last earnings call that we were consolidating three brands, eliminating three brands and consolidating them into our larger brands that was RN Demand, which was based in Texas, Platinum Nursing -- now the Platinum allied division continues on, but they had a small nursing component embedded within them, and then, our Preferred Healthcare brand, which was based in Fort Lauderdale. The rise in orders -- and just going back to your first question, we saw a decline in demand in the first part of the year, it started at really the end of '08, was very precipitous during the first quarter of '09. Probably more in line with our long-term strategy is to look for areas that we could expand into that are synergistic with our core businesses, so they have some heavy clinical labor component really leverage our expertise in recruitment in credential lane and within our hospital clients, but are different in that they have less exposure to economic cycles, aren't as sensitive and that would sure come in handy right now and I think longer term. The more recent announcements have been to close the office in Broomfield, Colorado, which is where our Medical ExpressSM brand was housed. It's also a little bit tough to compare the competitors apples to apples because different competitors have different components that are being reported in their Nurse and Allied segments. To have a segment of our business that had a more recurring revenue component to it would be very attractive for us, and certainly for our shareholders. Started to see orders stabilize in late March, April. It stayed flat until kind of the late June, July timeframe, and then started to see them rise, and that's an earlier point than we might normally see, kind of our usual winter pickup, so we saw that as a positive sign that it was more than just a seasonal anticipation, it was really more of a response to overall increased demand, both because of admissions, but also because we are hearing just more anecdotally that the nurses, the permanent nurses are pushing back a little bit more of regarding working overtime, taking on more patients, working more days, et cetera. And first of all, we are encouraged by the recent increases in orders, and the momentum that we're starting to see."

Based on the current state of our industry and the projected future growing needs of our clients, we believe this is the perfect addition to AMN to enhance long-term shareholder value. We also anticipate the addition of Medfinders' local staffing capabilities will create revenue synergies as AMN will be able to fill the daily and local contract staffing needs of our existing clients. Unallocated overhead, excluding stock compensation in the second quarter, was $7 million, as compared to $5.6 million in the prior year and $5.7 million in the prior quarter. This is incremental revenue opportunity for AMN since today, we do not have the capabilities to directly provide quick response local staff to our clients. Despite this, we continue to secure a larger portion of the available jobs due to our managed services and preferred clients, and we improved fill rates. The increases compared to prior quarter is due almost entirely to costs incurred associated with the Medfinders transaction for legal, accounting and operational due diligence and planning for integration. While our market is still constrained, our teams are performing extremely well, and their steadfast commitment to execution and building stronger and deeper client relationships is being rewarded by the clients. Home healthcare is viewed as an attractive solution to the cost pressures felt by hospitals and payers as they aim to provide quality post-acute care in a lower-cost setting. As we look at the rest of the year, we see margins holding steady with potential for modest improvement from continued management of compensation packages. The business saw flat sequential volumes as a result of order levels staying above prior year but still at relatively low levels. Days filled increased by 8% sequentially, and gross margin held steady sequentially at about 26.2%. During this time, we believe AMN can further differentiate our leadership position by remaining laser focused on execution in our core existing businesses, while at the same time, expanding our capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our clients. Because of the complementary nature of our business models, we will also be able to achieve immediate sales and operating efficiencies. Consistent with our track record, we intend to continue closely managing our profitability, cash flow and debt structure. Going into the third quarter, we anticipate Nurse and Allied Travel volumes will be up sequentially based on slightly stronger order and placement levels in June and July. Where appropriate, we will leverage our combined resources and capabilities. As we address your questions though, please keep in mind that we are still in the early integration planning stages and the deal will not close for several weeks, so we will not be able to provide any details regarding integration plans. We will continue this discipline of integrating and streamlining our newly combined organization in order to achieve sales and operational synergies. These types of client relationships typically experience higher fill rates and create a more recurring and predictable revenue stream over time. As we are all aware, throughout last year, the company took significant steps to streamline the organization and improve overall operating structure of the company in order to achieve sustained efficiency. The combination also strengthens our capabilities in existing businesses and enables us to expand into Home Health services. Medfinders generated approximately $300 million in revenues during 2009. In the second quarter, we generated $6.8 million of operating cash flow, of which about $1.4 million went to reduce debt. Days filled volumes increased by 8%, which had increases across all specialties, and the strongest gains were in surgery, behavioral health and primary care. However, the short-term demand environment is still constrained by general economic uncertainty and high unemployment. Medfinders generated approximately $20 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2009. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward- looking statements. By increasing our presence and capabilities in the managed services space, AMN can become an even better partner to our clients who are looking to increase their revenue and operational efficiency. In addition to the current client benefits, the combined strength of our MSP platforms and our fulfillment capabilities will no doubt resonate positively with healthcare facilities who are contemplating moving to MSP arrangements in the future. These strategic initiatives will continue to fuel future growth while diversifying our revenue and earnings. We continue to see a high utilization of COBRA due to the current government subsidy program. Like the AMN Healthcare team, Medfinders is also a thought leader in the industry and is sought out by healthcare organizations to continue improving their quality and cost effectiveness. One of our greatest challenges facing us today is hiring and training new recruiters to help fill the growing number of search opportunities. During the last three months, the aggregate number of assignment orders and the number of facility units with orders have increased across the country, reflecting a modest but still healthy rise in demand. The sequential increase was driven primarily by increases in our Locum Tenens and Physician Permanent Placement businesses, with our Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue holding steady during the quarter. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and other periodic reports, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. As we enter into the third quarter, the company continues to stay focused on everyday execution in order to capture as much market share as possible as we enter this phase of modest recovery. We anticipate the combination will generate annualized synergies in excess of $10 million, and assuming that amortization will track consistently with past experience, we expect the transaction to be accretive to full year earnings in 2011. The sequential improvement was due to increases in both placements and activity on new searches. Acute- care facilities are also recognizing their need to partner with organizations to effectively transition their discharged patients into a quality home health environment in order to improve outcomes and avoid readmission. Recent examples have been our organic launch into recruitment process outsourcing and our managed services offering. We are also anticipating Locum Tenens to again show sequential volume and revenue increases based on growth in days sold and days filled in the second quarter.","So we see this as an opportunity to be more innovative and be a stronger partner even with our acute care facilities because we now have this new capability. Can you comment on any customers that represent a meaningful material portion of your business that we should be aware of? And so while we'll be adding to it, we think that even the recruitment staff that we have there has more capacity. And in the order counts, in order trends, we're actually seeing growth across the entire country again as well, which we know, again, we're looking for all the positive signs we can see in the business and not just seeing growth within one account. There's millions of dollars of business there that we affiliate out, and then we will now be able to fulfill against ourselves. The other thing that's still positive about their local staffing capabilities is what it does for us in MSP. What we're talking to them about, certainly, the cash flow generated by the combined organization, looking at synergies and how everyone haircuts those. It's a difficult role, and it takes about six months to even a year to really get somebody fully trained to be productive. And when they go into a home, we do -- the caregivers, when they get into a home, they can actually record what they did while they were there, and it automatically flows into the system. We've got, I think, a good comfort on the part of AMN during their due diligence process. And you can see that even going to the third quarter, we're projecting growth, and yet, our recruiter count is fairly flat. Maybe I'll kind of take the top level and then ask Ralph to fill in some details. And we believe that and know that because we've seen from our own experience that when we have our own MSP, we can have higher fill rates for the travel positions. One of the key things about the MSP environment is that when order volumes go down, you essentially fill more of your own orders with your own services. And so early on, we worked collaboratively with Bob and the Medfinders team in order to really define those synergies and to dig in to both organizations and identify where those synergies are going to come from. So you got to have people that know what they're doing, and Linda's many, many years in the business, I won't [indiscernible]... Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director And Linda's very impressive, and I'll echo Bob's comments regarding their commitment to compliance and quality. We brought in external advisers to help us with the diligence in this area knowing it was a new area for us, and we were very pleased to see the high marks that they received in their commitment to quality and compliance. Joshua David Vogel Sidoti & Company, LLC And I guess given your cash flow trends and your expectations for Medfinders, do you have an idea of, or strategy of how you plan to pay down debt or where you would want the balance to be by, say, the end of 2011? As I mentioned, our greater challenge is just hiring enough and training enough good recruiters to fulfill that growing demand. And then the revenue synergies are driven by existing contracts that we have that we believe that we can have greater fill rates at. In fact, many of the local assignments that they're staffing are contract in nature, meaning they're multi-week bookings. While we think the per diem sector is a necessary part to be in, in order to meet our customers' need, all of our locations are focused on using that facility as a way to manage multiple accounts with exclusivity through our MSP program. Bary G. Bailey Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer Hard to define, I'm going to say material. They're some of the more obvious areas you would expect around corporate synergies that we'll benefit from immediately: in insurance, purchasing power, risk management, legal, all of kind of the traditional areas, as well as back office functions and different places where we think we can be more efficient through a combined organization. Including the synergies, that's certainly how we're looking at it, and that's a lot of the value of the combined organizations is what we can accomplish together, both in filling more of our current clients' needs and certainly be more efficient in our operations. But really seeing it across the country is one of those things we're banking on and I think why you're seeing a little optimism on our part more than normal. Albert J. William Rice Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division I mean, obviously, the big chains that are out there have had some issues both with, I guess, recent government inquiries, as well as some pressure on future reimbursements. Gary Paul Taylor Citigroup Inc, Research Division So it's not material in the sense that we may have a few years paying no cash taxes. But as a part of the company, they can fill a much higher percentage of those local staffing needs. So we were able to grow actually our Nurse Travel business during the period when everybody else was shrinking, simply because we were able to fill more of our own orders and especially within our MSP clients. So from a materiality standpoint, there's not a high-level concentration for the overall organization. But even with the other major suppliers that are out there, whether the names that you know well, but many, many you probably don't know well, are really related to specific requirements that clients have within their markets, where they say, ""I've worked with so and so for a while and I'd like to continue to work with them."" But as I said earlier, just knowing the sheer talent of these two combined teams and  the collaborative spirit and the passion that I've seen from them, I am completely confident that we will be able to deliver on our synergy and growth expectations. Albert J. William Rice Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division And is there any reason why -- what's the constraining thing on when you'd have the vote? And so while we haven't begun the detail integration planning, we do have a larger road map identified and have very specific targets for each of our divisions and departments that we intend to go after. So we set up a process that we think is very efficient with their AP departments, and we found that it has -- I think we have one of the lowest DSOs in the industry right now. They only have one invoice to pay. Incorporated, Research Division So with the margins being what they are and the efficiency in terms of the DSOs, when we take a look at the terms of the deal, Bob, how did the debt get accumulated? I mean as you've noticed and you said here on the phone is we've been pretty solid in our cash flow collections. It takes about three months to get somebody ready up to production levels that are profitable. So being able to leverage the strong MSP contracts and relationships that Medfinders has, where they have significant travel orders -- and we're filling some of those now but at a fairly lower level because there are other competitors in there, and we believe we can fill a higher percentage. But he made a comment earlier that I think is really important and that is that their local staffing offices are really a platform to help both win and to very successfully operate those MSPs by having that local presence and capability. It's a combination of revenue generated and cost synergies, although the larger share are on the cost side. And likewise, MSP contracts that we have, where we have local positions that we can't fill at all and maybe Medfinders is in there filling some of them now. Does this have a material impact on your forward cash tax rate? Obviously with this transaction, we'll have our own capabilities in that area. With that said, I also mentioned that we're seeing nice, modest but healthy increases in orders, travelers on assignment and just kind of the underlying health of the business across the country. And additionally, in the Allied business, we've been able to fill openings in kind of less than 30 days. Or is there any pass-through where you're doing an MSP and it's actually being fulfilled through somebody else? I've been in the business a long time, but it really takes leaders like Linda Sheffield, who'll be remaining with the business and is our President of our division, and she's very excited about the expansion. We do expect to have more new recruiters coming online and beginning to work in production in the third quarter. And the way the Medicare program had been set up in the past, it allows you to leverage the therapy business. What would potentially lead the cost synergies to be less than what you're projecting? Bary G. Bailey Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer No, we obviously haven't set that because we're in process of going out to the market. AMN is by far the largest of our subcontractors and the most valued because they historically have been able to provide a wider range of skills and particularly in the subspecialties and in greater volume with higher-quality nurses than anyone in the market. Most people think of home health as a very separate business and don't always make the connection back to acute care, but as we were going through our diligence and just in my discussions with CEOs at hospitals, we're starting to get more questions about our capability to help transition patients effectively and quickly out of the acute care setting and into a quality home health environment."

This is higher than the previously estimated full-year tax rate, due in part to the decision to close our U.K. office, which limits the deductibility of losses in this operation, as well as cost associated with amending our credit agreement. Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 69%, which reflects the true-up of our tax expense for the full-year projected tax rate of approximately 60% to 62%. For both travel and local nurse staffing supply is becoming an increasing constraint to meet the raising demand. In June, the number of facilities with travel nurse orders was up over 40% with last year. There are no material changes to the annual financial estimates we provided earlier in the year for depreciation, amortization, share account our capital expenditures. Longer term as lower reimbursement levels and mounting costs continue to pressure hospital operating margins, providers are seeking strong partners and innovative approaches to their care delivery and business processes. This objective evaluation of our MSP program consisted of a rigorous multi step review and was based on our proven effectiveness, our quality, value and customer support. As we saw orders jump in the second half of 2010, we may see this gap narrow a little bit later this year. Due to lower client demand and poor financial performance, we are in the process of closing this U.K. office, which will have an impact on both revenue and SG&A and reduce third quarter EBITDA by approximately 600,000. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Our local staffing offices continue to be a key part of our success in winning and filling MSP business. The NCQA certification assures clients that our credentialing processes are consistent with the highest standards of physician and practitioner credentialing in the industry. The growth in orders is also geographically dispersed, with our top five states spanning the West, the Northwest, Northeast, the Southeast and the South. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and other periodic reports, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. As I mentioned on July 25, we executed an amendment to our credit agreement to increase our revolver from $40 million to $50 million and adjust certain financial covenants to maximize our operating flexibility for the longer term. Travel nurse order levels have been increasing for well over a year now and have generally been running more than 75% above prior year. Gross margin is anticipated to be between 27% and 27.5%, SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately 22% of revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin is projected to be approximately 6%. Although demand trends in local staffing are generally increasing, they are less consistent across different regions and there are challenges in recruiting supply in certain markets. The gross margin was sequentially lowered by 70 basis points due to a high margin staffing project with a single client during the previous quarter. Second quarter operating cash flow was $2.4 million. It also allows our clients to reduce their workload when bringing an AMN physician into their organization. We are prudently adding team members, primarily in sales and operation in connection with growth and travel nursing and the implementation and ongoing support of new MSP contracts, as well as increasing our investment in targeted marketing programs to add supply to meet growing demands. Another good sign for the next few quarters is that we have already begun to receive a significant number of winter orders for some of our larger clients. With clinical wages representing on average 40% of hospital revenues our clients are looking for ways to flex and more tightly manage their workforce. To further endorse our commitment to providing quality physicians, AMN recently applied for and was awarded certification status as a credentials verification organization with the national committee for quality assurance. While top-line growth is progressing we have experienced some headwinds in our direct costs, such as higher apartment rents, travel expenses due to fuel costs and some increases in clinician compensation packages. While we do have an advantage in the market with our substantial candidate database, we are also making incremental investments in Canada marketing to target additional supply. Unallocated overhead, excluding stock compensation and integration expenses in the second quarter was $7.5 million, a slight decrease in the preceding quarter of $7.7 million and higher than the prior expense of $5.9 million. Our home healthcare segment generated revenue of $13.9 million and operating income $0.4 million for the quarter. With penalties for the readmissions beginning in October 2012 and the planning for ACOs, hospitals are more focused than ever on reducing re-admissions.","And also how much more does it cost to fill positions on average now? What's the reception there in terms of that thought process? If I go back 5 to 10 years ago, we would start to receive our so-called winter orders in the August timeframe. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer I think you hit the big ones, I mean as I mentioned our cash tax rate we’re projecting to be about 20% this year. I think nurse managers have also - they like the study, they have been asking for copies of it, the number of hits on our website, we put a calculator up last - two weeks ago now, we’ve seen a lot of activity there and people who basically come in and register to use that calculator, so we do capture some marketing information when they’re there. I’ll start with the fill rate question. It's more just looking out and saying, hey, you know, variability in the business, we just need a little more flexibility on our covenants. And we mentioned before, in terms of the big projects, we're completed with those, and are hitting our cost synergy targets, we kind of completed that and we're on track to begin those numbers in the third quarter on an annualized basis, but there are just a few things that we’re wrapping up, continued opportunities to improve our operating model. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director The primary driver has been the revenue synergies from the direct sell initiative from the contracts that we already had in place that AMN brought to the table, Metfinders brought to the table, these MSP contracts where we were now able to fill more of their travel needs or their local needs. So, its kind of, it is a good news, bad news story as we slow down a little bit and the clients respond and get involved in helping us get those fill rates back up. With that said, we don’t see them affecting our business today and some of the reasons could be that on the unemployment rate for example that the additional supply that was brought into the permanent nursing market, the way that hospitals were able to really stretch their permanent labor or maybe bring in retired nurses back into the workforce, that’s kind of run it’s course I still think some of those people are in permanent positions, are still working more hours, but many of them have also gotten burned out and have said, no I can’t do this anymore and you’ve seen that as translate into greater strikes. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the fill rates that you're seeing on the travel nurse side. I was wondering if, you know part of the reason for giving the winter orders early is because of potentially it being more challenging to fill positions. Again a huge thanks to our team members, it’s because of their commitment, hard work and their talent that we are to able to report these solid results today and why we are optimistic about the future. We were consistent with our first quarter fill rates and we’ve talked about this before we fill about a third of our traditional orders and about two thirds of our MSP orders we fill ourselves so you could do the math figure of where we come it, it is almost statistically the same quarter-over-quarter. In fact, we’re starting to get orders for Q3 four months from now. We actually improved our fill rates in the most recent month, which in June just kind of finalized our fill rates there. I think we have to be flexible and ready for any scenario. I guess you're sort of stable, it looks like quarter-to-quarter, on working capital, but any other areas where it will affect the cash flow trends for the Company? Definitely travel orders are up in July. So, as we try to attract them out of firm jobs, just a little bit more pay will help bring them back to travel as well as seeing kind of the huge numbers we are seeing in terms of total orders we give them a center to stable place to put their careers. What we’re seeing though is the time it takes us to fill is taking a little bit longer than hospitals are used to so, what we used to fill somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% of jobs within the first seven days and fill in like 17%. But also they begin to place their orders just a little bit more in advance, and they add flexibility. So Ralph, do you want to give some more color on orders? When do you start to get your peak orders for the winter season coming through? I know obviously if we get growth in earnings, that pretty much directly obviously benefits your cash flow, but if we look at the back half of the year and even into next year, are there any other sort of non-earnings driven things that we should be thinking about for benefiting your cash flow? AJ Rice Susquehanna Capital And then my final question will be just on your cash flow expectations. To me, that tends to suggest some pressure on you sourcing supply of nurses. And we’ve had more strike activity in the country in the nursing profession than I’ve seen in many, many years and I think that indicative of the burnout and the frustration of those nurses saying no more. Future booking trends are trending positive from a bill rate basis, so I just, now it’s just a little bit more of continuing to grind a way out and waiting sometime for the assignments to end and new assignments to start. Frank Pinkerton SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Okay and then on the traveler nursing side, I guess first part any color you can give us on orders in July and also talk a little bit about maybe the supply environment? Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Sure, and Ralph is here, so I will have him answer the majority of it, but as I mentioned in my comments we’re seeing continued strong orders really across those MSP and traditional clients. As that stabilizes over a longer period of time, we’ll start to see our operating cash flow improve as well. And then on the hospital side, you know, the last three months we've seen weaker patient utilization through the channel. Ralph S. Henderson President of Professional Services & Staffing Yeah, I would say it is more challenging to fill positions. It helps to keep the fill rates up, it helps people supply come back into the market, and it helps the hospitals and meet their staffing need. Ralph S. Henderson President of Professional Services & Staffing On the cost of fill positions, our administrative costs and our internal costs are going down, and we continue to gain leverage. Right now the scenario we are seeing and that we are going after is a growth scenario and so that’s how we are positioned, but we need to remain flexible if we see that change. And then I was just interested in your comment about doing the amendment with the bank deal and getting more flexibility out of the covenants. What we’re able to do because we’re now together as one Company, is be able to provide the full spectrum and it’s not only the travel side that we used to be able to provide very effectively, but now we can do also the per diem, we can manage the flow pool, we can to provide RPO services. Can you just expand a little bit on what covenants maybe were changed, and what is the more flexibility you were looking for there? You are able to better educate your clients that they need to raise bill rates in order to not only offset rising costs, but in order to keep the pay rates competitive and to attract the limited supply that’s out there and particularly in the areas like OR which is one of our highest demands if they can’t fill our us OR positions they may have to close the OR, which has lost revenue for them. If we are doing things that’s just part of the business to continue to become more efficient, but I think the third quarter, we're starting a few small projects. Those clients are typically looking for more of a strategic partner and wanting to really get their arms around our total spend and find ways to reduce the costs, but maintain the quality. So the team did a great job of really aggressively beginning that education process and those conversations late last year, early this year and I think we mentioned on our last call that we had made great progress in bill rate increases. Yes, we're - on the ten contracts, actually about a third of those were replacements of existing incumbents, but actually our pipeline right now and contracts that are in final negotiation stage for the third quarter includes even more as a percentage going forward. I think we’ll see more activity around that when they start to set their budgets for next year. The majority of our orders have always come from traditional clients; but we’ve seen good growth in both and really good sign is that we started to receive some of our winter seasonal need. Probably a little bit more, but we’ve seen good in-flows right now and we are comfortable at the level we are at, but we will obviously continue to try to push to - to move that down and to the extent that we are able to, it would and in that period that we do it would increase operating cash flow. Bob Livonius I'd also (inaudible) just one of the reasons I think we get these winter orders is the more - the changing relationship you have with the clients when you are an MSP, you are working with them to plan for their need as opposed to being reactive as one of many. So that tells you to facilitates themselves are planning ahead for that need and in our locums division our days sold are up on a quarter-over- quarter basis and continuing to tick up in July. So, the factor that we’ve started to receive some of them in late July is actually, we think a really good sign that our - again our clients are planning for their future needs and they are already so tightly staffed that they don't want to wait until the last minute to count on getting the staff that they need."

In July, order levels have remained relatively steady and we anticipate third quarter revenue to grow modestly on a sequential basis and at mid-single-digits year-over-year. The strategic workforce solutions we provide include: managed services programs, recruitment process outsourcing, electronic medical records, implementation staffing and other workforce consulting services. Clients with orders and clients with clinicians on assignment, were also both up year-over-year and sequentially which is always a good sign of a healthier client and order base. Our total cash taxes paid this year are expected to be $1 million to $2 million, resulting in a cash tax rate of less than 10%, due in large parts continued utilization of tax benefits from the Medfinders acquisitions. The growth was driven by strong fill rates, rebook rates and an increased supply of nurse applicants. This includes approximately $1 million in cost related to the strategic initiatives to grow our future candidate supply and enhance our workforce solutions. The Allied team continues to invest in marketing spend to drive more candidate supply. We expect total SG&A expenses in the third quarter to increase sequentially by about $1 million driven in part by investments being made in our strategic workforce solutions and new recruitment and candidate supply initiatives. First it is clear that the evolving sophistication of our clients is translating into greater differentiation of our capabilities in the market. As a result, they are seeking highly capable partners who they can collaborate with and trust to deliver on their core staffing needs and develop new solutions. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and our other filings with the SEC which are publicly available. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.0 for the second quarter. The sequential volume increase was due to higher days filled with behavioral health, ER and anesthesia. At the same time, we're making investments in marketing spend and building innovative recruitment approaches to drive more candidate supply. Revenue was impacted from the lower demand in certain markets as well as candidate supply constraints and the disruption from operational changes. Excluding the impact of the debt refinancing, our second quarter and full-year projected tax rate is approximately 45%, which is lower than our previous estimate of about 50%. They also continue to experience strong rebook rates and improvement in sales productivity. Going in to the third quarter, July orders are up in the double-digits over the second quarter, and we expect to see our third quarter Traveler count volume up in the mid-teens year-over-year. In the second quarter, approximately 1/3 of our Nurse and Allied revenue was from MSP clients who are relying upon us to manage and fill their clinical staffing needs. The year-over-year improvement was due to the absence of integration related expenses and improved SG&A leverage, partly offset by higher professional liability cost and increased spending on candidate supply and workforce solutions initiatives. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $21 million and capital expenditures for the second quarter were $1.2 million. While orders were softer at the beginning of the year, in the second quarter, they grew consistently and today orders are up slightly year-over-year. The shortages will be fueled by the ageing clinical labor force which will begin retiring in greater numbers. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, should, would, project, may, variations of such words and other similar expressions. Our integration activities last year and the improved gross margin management have begun paying off, as we continue to experience operating leverage through revenue growth. In the second quarter, we continued to win new MSP and RPO contracts due to the strength of our offering and our ability to deliver higher fill rates to our clients. Regarding our policy on forward-looking statements, various remarks and characterizations we make during this call about future expectations, projections, plans, prospects, events or circumstances constitute forward-looking statements.","So it was great evidence that the market you know is ready for one single large provider and doesn’t have to be fragmented in order to operate effectively. We had little bit of activity in the second quarter, but they are really ramping up more in the third and fourth quarter, so I would expect a third quarter to be again in that incremental $1 million and the fourth quarter even a little bit more than that and having that taper off as we go into 2013. The traditional business fill rate actually jumped up at the same time as well. We are seeing quite a big increase in our applicant supply, I think we are up 34% year-over-year on applicant supply. And so as a percentage, yes we are seeing more applicants come in, but remember it's also smaller base, so we are still not back to the weekly new candidate flow that we were adding in our peak levels. So while we are very pleased to see it improving and at the pace that we are seeing and we are doing all that we can to accelerate that and drive it, we still have ways to go to, get back to the historically high levels of new supply. So we did a correlation analysis to take a look at what happened to fill rates when we added MSPs in the market. I think the other driver in this MSP is the whole quality aspect. So I don’t know about the prior cycles. I don't know if you saw an article on modern healthcare talking about hospital-borne infections and the impact it's going to have on quality if you don’t have enough nurses covering the patients that you have; it’s a great article for our industry talking about why it's actually less expensive for you to bring in more nurses than its going to cost you for the infections that are created by not having enough; pretty powerful story. I don't think that we have any signs that we will see some improvement in this market, I mean it's, I think I called this out on our last call as, what was our biggest strength for so many years right, has become our greatest weakness over the last few quarters as that business because of reimbursement rate changes just, changing dramatically as well as new technologies in the industry and other things that just made that the work more efficient and so they needed fewer radiologists. There were some EMR implementation projects; as there are every quarter and we like to add business and we are known as being either the leader or one of the absolute top leaders in providing that service. So just pure recruiter execution and recruiter productivity. And so we think it will be great opportunity to help increase supply somewhat short-term, but even more so quite so honestly it’s a longer-term investment to make sure that we have the supply available as we expect demand for all clinicians quite honestly to be ramping up pretty strongly over the next couple of years. Albert J. William Rice UBS Investment Bank, Research Division And I want to ask you about the $1 million of expenses run through SG&A for the strategic initiatives around future candidate supply and new workforce solutions, and maybe I should remember this, but is that been a recurring expense that you have been incurring or is that and do you think that will stay in the second half or is that going away and maybe expand a little bit about what you are exactly doing there? The number of orders that we have at each of those clients is still down, about 1/2 of what it was at the peak of the industry but the number of active clients has increased and again these are probably things that our supply here, they hear about orders, they see travelers coming back and that makes them more comfortable leaving their permanent positions and moving into travel positions. And as clients move more and more in to this sophisticated model of getting paid for performance and quality, they're beginning to really recognize the value of having a partner that can make sure that when they have needs that the orders are filled. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director And this is where I think we also should have an advantage in our ability to grow our supplier faster because we do have probably twice as many travelers working than any other competitors out in the field and they are telling their friends and family about the opportunities and where they are working and that’s like having many more recruiters out there generating supply for you. But that’s why we are investing in the digital transformation project, our recruiters and all those things that we think can help us accelerate it at a faster pace. So having that exclusive relationship where you’re seeing all the orders, all at the same time is really powerful in terms of being able to very target the recruiting efforts to those markets. Ralph S. Henderson President of Professional Services & Staffing Susan might want to comment on the prior cycles. Vacancies are at an all-time low for the nation's apartment property managers and so we need to make sure that we keep our vacancies low as well, so that we don’t have idle space sitting there that we’re paying for. I think we have done quite bit of fine-tuning our process over the last couple of years and so our marketing is just far more targeted than it used to be and it’s converting at higher rates almost double what it was in kind of the peak of the market in 2008. So the short answer is our pipeline is very strong. Are you seeing, I mean you are obviously seeing improving spread, are you seeing higher pay levels or is that holding steady? Our efforts, our increased marketing efforts are making the process easier for people to apply and all of that probably contributing kind of if I wanted to sort of allocate it, maybe 2/3 of it and 1/3 of it feeling better about the marketplace. The other thing that benefits us are the MSP relationships that we have and been able to convert more of that new supply that comes in the door because of the productivity and efficiency that we have in getting those people placed and the word of mouth that comes from that I think helps feed on itself as well. It's going to be a little lumpy, because as you move people out of one specialty and into another their production isn't as high and so that's why you see us kind of forecasting flat growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Do you think there is a different dynamic in this cycle? They are wanting to be proactive today to try to get their arms around their spend, yes for today, but even more so they are thinking 3 to 4 years out and how do they make sure that they can have their arms around their costs, reduce their overall spending and yet still maintain the quality and quantity of clinicians that they need going back to what Bob said, they recognize its going to get harder to recruit clinicians across the board with the ageing clinical population coupled with an ageing population and health care reform, the shortages across all clinical specialties are expected to be really severe. We fill a high percentage of them, but rely on over 600 different providers as our subcontractors. Gary Paul Taylor Citigroup Inc, Research Division And what do you think is the major factor on that supply being up, I guess may be historically we would have thought, it would take a little stronger macro job environment to see the travel supply picking up. And that’s the uniqueness I think of the MSP model because you know, we don’t fill them all ourselves. The difference between this cycle and the prior 2 that we have seen is the duration of the contraction and the suppression in demand and that probably created a longer suppression in the supply and so you have some pent-up supply that has been wanting to come back or come into the travel industry. We also have been able to use technology better than we ever had in the past and when Susan talks about the digital transformation, I think there is even opportunities to do stuff in that area like the mobile devices which will increase our conversion in our supply trends as well. Well and behold, we found out that actually are internal fill rates went up, the more MSP business we added to the overall portfolio. I do believe that a lot of the supply that's coming into the market is supply that has gotten more comfortable with the demand level. Incorporated, Research Division And then with regards to MSP wins; can you talk a little bit more about the pipeline in terms of hospitals that are putting in employees? There was kind of a hypothesis that if you have too many that your fill rates might decline slightly because you wouldn’t have enough nurses to cover all of the, I guess the demand for the marketplace."

And a third is the streamlining of our systems and infrastructure for greater efficiency, scalability and agility. This holdback settlement was recorded through unallocated corporate overhead. Third quarter interest expense will be $2 million and capital expenditures are projected to be $3 million. The second is our leading edge recruitment technologies such as job distribution platforms and mobile applications to aggressively attract more candidate supply and to create a better candidate experience. For the remainder of 2013, our MSP pipeline remains robust and we anticipate further penetration across all of our staffing businesses throughout the year. We also began generating some incremental revenue from the new Locums MSPs that were being implemented in the first quarter. Gross margin improved by 280 basis points from the prior year and 10 basis points from the prior quarter from improved recruiter productivity. The continued growth was driven by increases in new searches, placements and sourcing revenues. To address the current market challenges in therapy, we have realigned our resources and the team is concentrating on increasing our fill rates at MSP clients as well as targeting the less impacted acute care outpatient and home health client settings. Normally, we would expect to be up slightly in the third quarter, but since the orders were down throughout most of Q2, it’s unlikely the sequential impact will be overcome by recent uptick in orders and the higher anticipated EMR business. Based on the new search activity in the second quarter we anticipate third quarter physician perm revenue to be up in the mid-teens year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. We continued to make progress in expanding our position as the nation’s innovator in healthcare workforce solutions increasing AMN’s mix of revenue that is coming from MSP clients is a key part of our strategy as the higher fill rates enable us to grow faster during periods of market expansion and provide some protection during periods of demand softness.

So HR, legal, finance, those costs we don’t allocate out to the different segments, so any of our back office costs like payroll and housing and those areas we do allocate, but certain one that are more true kind of corporate overhead, we are leaving that corporate unallocated. There is some mention of the looking towards the future and what their volumes might be and how they might create a more efficient and flexible labor and work for situation, that’s what’s driving a lot of the discussion around MSP. So our fill rates on MSP orders for travel nurse were up 400 basis points Q2 last year to Q2 this year and up 1800 basis points in our Allied from Q2 last year to Q2 this year. These types of temporary reductions to manage to lower patient volume or budget constraints and things like that we’ve been seeing those for years. So are any of the hospitals saying, hey, obviously we haven’t seen any of it yet, that’s very clear, but as coverage expansion starts to rollout in ‘14, we may be faced with some material demand growth and we want to talk about contingency planning for how to staff that or is it entirely too premature to be having that type of conversation? And projections are still what I am hearing is more enough 4% to 5% year-over-year increases in rents. Well, first regarding the trends that we have seen more recently, we would typically expect to see orders going up in July, because now is when we begin to get in our winter seasonal needs. That’s certainly healthcare systems and physician practices adding nurse practitioners and physician assistants to help them manage care at a lower cost, but more efficiently so, big increases there, and in case managers which help direct the patient to the right type of care, big increases in that - in that segment as well. The flu season really impacts our Q1 to Q2 trend and really basically we started seeing orders drop kind of mid February and they declined from that high point for several months and only recently began they are ticking up again, I think you probably did miss that part of the call, in the last 5 or 6 weeks. It allows you to be the - when there is a slower demand, you are not forced to cut down your orders you actually just fill more of your own business and give less of it to the subcontractors. And frankly, just a comment on more than just MSP, it’s the workforce solutions, it’s the MSP plus the RPO and the consulting, to kind of come together is a very powerful story to tell clients. So they’re trying to right size the work force to get the right blend of both temporary and permanent labor so, that when they get to a higher volume and there is a more influx is labor that they are prepared for - either prepared because they have a better ability to hire their own people and we help them with that or the ability to bring on additional staff when they need to, I think it’s I wouldn’t draw a thesis that people are going to start using more contract labor proportionately because there is growth, more so that absolute growth will be good for both permanent and contract labor. So any time that clients are looking to find ways to serve patients better by consolidating either systems coming together or ACO formation that generally speaks to high level strategic thinking around how they can improve their overall efficiency and 50% of the cost of running these hospitals is labor. The Nursing business would be more typically flat to up in the fourth quarter and it probably remains to be seen how much of these new orders are going to continue to grow and when the start dates will kick in to make that happen. It typically lasts one to 2 quarters, then clients tend to put them on the shelf after that as burnout increases overtime starts to go up. And in fact we have had more orders at more facilities kind of growing over the last month. Tobey O'Brien Sommer SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division And I wanted to ask Susan a question kind of a little bit longer term in just the next couple of quarters, maybe next couple of years, are you having conversations with hospitals in which they are discussing with you the kind of an aspiration to materially increase the percentage of their labor that is flexible? What goes into that is really is primarily from our back office overhead cost. And we have talked about it before, but we expect that whatever increasing cost we have there which isn’t that material would be offset by increases in pricing passed along to customers, so not a big event for us. And the amount if it was larger, so we nearly have some type of adjustment and sometimes they are not material and I first mentioned it could be just a few 100,000 either way this particular quarter, the Nurse and Allied segment for example was not material, but on the Locums, it was of a larger magnitude. Where those that are focused on that are starting to put together their game plans for how they are going to staff, and we would think we would be a great solution for them, because we are very flexible right, our assignment lengths can be shorter, they can react quicker to that demand. Anecdotally, there have been a few comments and discussions around how they might create a more flexible workforce and have a slightly lower core staff and more flexible staffing, but that’s also just driven around always trying to find the right mix of staffing to make sure that you have access to clinicians when you need them, but don’t have excess labor cost and staff when you don’t. So I think it probably has been accelerated slightly, just minimal discussions that are occurring have been accelerated slightly by the fact that they know they are going to have to come up with more flexible cost structures, but I wouldn’t say it’s a trend yet. Like we have a very strong partnership with Novation and they are working directly with their clients on identifying ways in which these new organizational structures that our servicing clients need to be more cost efficient. So we think that benefited us and then we’ve added resources as we saw the momentum and then the revenue opportunity going into this year, but it’s not material enough to breakout as a segment, so I’m sorry, we are not really reporting it. And one last one if I may, Brian I may have missed it in your commentary, but what goes  into the unallocated corporate overhead line and what drove that down about $2.5 million sequentially and should $6 million be the quarterly run-rate we should be looking for going forward? Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director For the third quarter that we are already almost half way into the third quarter, a lot of bookings have already been made certainly what’s already transpired that we also book most of our assignments weeks in advance and so we have pretty good visibility on what volumes ought to be for the third quarter. We seem to have our resources in the right place, our process improvement efforts are paying off and the team is performing very well both at our Staff Care and our Linde brands. So that’s why in the second quarter the rate was 38% to kind of true up to that projected full year rate. Ralph I might ask you to give a little more on the orders themselves. The demand was up and we use a definition of days available to fill right, the number of shifts we have and it was up about 5% may be 6% year-over-year and it was pretty much across the board there were some specialty driven demand things I will talk about those in a second. Our recruiter productivity in placements are the highest that we’ve seen in many years and that a tribute certainly to the recruiters in the talent. So if you take a look at our booking trends in Q2, despite the volume being flat we actually booked more that we did same quarter last year."

AMN, RPO will manage the entire recruitment screening and selection from job requisition through new higher on boarding for facility clients, AMN experience in recruiting and credentialing 1000 of clinical professionals every year will allow us to improve our facilities time to hire and the quality of the candidate pool, resulting in reduced hiring cost. This expense is comprised of 2.6 million in depreciation and 1.2 million in amortization, compared to the same quarter last year, depreciation increased by 600,000 due mainly to internally developed software projects, the placement service in late 2007. These changes will also cause some variation in our future quarterly tax rates including the fourth quarter of 2008, when we estimate our projected quarterly effective tax rate could increase to as much as 49%. Some of these initiatives will generate minimal revenue for 2008, but most are expected to drive incremental revenue in 2009 and beyond. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements. Our ability to recruit new supply quality Canada attract very closely to last year and we book rates of existing travelers are also attracting inline with the prior year. As I mentioned earlier in the year, we have several initiatives focused on further diversifying our product line and broadening our client base in order to expand our revenue growth opportunities. We have determined that the impact of this matter for AMN was immaterial to previously issued financial statements. The company generated 21 million of operating cash flow during the third quarter, which one combined with 6 million of net cash on hand and a 112 million of revolver draw downs, we used primarily the fund share repurchases, pay estimated tax and service our debt. Days filled volume overall for the Locum Tenens business increased 3% year- over-year and 1% sequentially. First, continuing to capture more market share; second, to innovate and drive efficiency and productivity gains which should further reduce our cost structure in the future; and third, continuing to expand and diversify our business by pursuing emerging market opportunities and responding to the changes within healthcare delivery. We could be performing better with improved processes and sales strategy. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Another is the launch of a recruitment process outsource offering which was announced earlier in October. Each produced double-digit revenue growth year-over-year and increase volumes and pricing. Looking forward however, the demand environment does appear more challenging as we’ve seen open orders for future assignments decline during September and October. Our bright spots are the Mid-West and the North West where we are seeing some strong year-over-year increases in orders. On a sequential basis overall revenue per day filled increased about 0.5% which was lead by primary care and surgery.","Certainly it is very competitive particularly in rehab, where you have a huge-huge demand for therapists and a very tight supply. I think this goes back to the prior question that was asked where we’re getting bill rate increases and we were making pay rate adjustment, but it takes a while for those pay rate changes to actually translate through to bookings. We see no reason this segment can’t become a $400 million to $500 million segment overtime, but we do need to make some internal changes, building process, sales strategy. I think in order to make that happen we’ve identified what some of those are but I also think Kim will help add to that. We have a revolver $75 million revolver, but so we're of course focusing in on the conditions and the key there would be pretty much collecting and holding onto cash. In addition to that though, we've had some challenges within a couple of our region, where our teams are just -- have not been performing at the levels we believe they are capable. There is not been a change in necessarily how the clients are booking, but relative to our history, we do have a larger piece of our business in the physician and allied segment. We think we need to continue as a business to expand our partnership with the hospitals and be not just, kind of that, fixed for a short term 8-week or 13-week assignment but to be more of a partner and how they manage their overall recruitment and labor needs. It has been a strong segment for us, and we've always talked you about radiology and that’s definitely been a material part of our business that is depressed. Susan Nowakowski Sure, we'll maybe just give you kind of order of magnitude the size of the different divisions, so that will be a good starting point? And you do have more short-term and sometimes quick bookings particularly in allied, where they may get an order and they want somebody to start in four or five days versus nursing where you’re generally booking kind of three to four weeks in advance. Hopefully it helps us to maintain what we think as an appropriate pay-to-bill spread."

Kaiser was seeking a strong partner who could consistently provide a high level of service and quality clinicians, across their numerous acute care facilities. Even within our own supply of anesthesiology locums, it appears the economic environment lower demand has created a desire to seek more employment certainty and during the middle of the year, we saw a larger number accepting permanent positions. Our Nursing and Allied orders grew through the third quarter and gained particular momentum in September and October. In addition, we have made solid moves to streamline our operating model and improve our cost structure, which has enabled us to continue growing our new service offerings while still maintaining respectable operating margins. It is difficult to predict the trajectory of future order growth but even at the current order levels which are above our traveler accounts, we believe there is opportunity for growth as we go into 2010. As the economy rebounds and attrition rates begin to rise, hospitals will ramp up their permanent recruitment again. The improvement in operating income in our Locums business was driven by continued improvements in our cost structure and by specialty mix, somewhat offset by lower days filled. Despite the lower demand levels, our recruitment and placement teams are doing an excellent job of recruiting candidates and increasing fill rates, which are higher than last year across all specialties. While our Nurse and Allied business appears to have stabilized more recently, based on travelers on assignment and outstanding order volume, we did see further erosion, as Susan noted, in our Anesthesia business within our Locum segment. While still below last year, today's nursing orders are the highest that they've been in 2009 and appear to be ticking up week-by-week. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect our SG&A spending levels to decline slightly as we experience the full benefit of our cost-reduction efforts, although increasing as a percentage of revenue due to the projected decline in fourth quarter revenue. Through the year, we have maintained our focus on execution by staying close to our customers and aggressively pursuing preferred relationships. Days filled volume for the quarter was down 10% over prior year and 3% sequentially. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and other quarterly and periodic reports which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. Patient flow from greater access to healthcare is also expected to increase as reform initiatives are implemented. The company continues to generate strong operating cash flow which was assisted by significant reductions in accounts receivable. And fourth, we have strengthened our balance sheet by paying down our debt and maintaining strong operating cash flow, enabling us to take advantage of future market expansion opportunities. The sequential decrease reflected in part a catch-up tax adjustment last quarter to true-up to the full-year projected rate. During the third quarter, we generated $19 million of operating cash flow, which was used primarily to pay down debt. Rather than move to capture share at any cost in a difficult market, we have focused on the quality of our earnings at both the gross profit and EBITDA levels by maintaining the highest levels of service and quality. Another example of execution today that will position us for future growth is our Recruitment Process Outsourcing service line which was launched less than a year ago. We have found that if facilities rationalize the number of providers they work with, we're benefiting from our strong historical relationships, our relentless focus on quality, our innovative reputation and the financial stability we have as the industry leader. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. We have had success growing our new days available and are working to build our available supply to fill this demand. Our ability to remain agile and execute well in the short-term, while keeping an eye on nurturing our new service lines will allow us to emerge from this economic cycle as a stronger leader, to be better a partner for our clients and well positioned to capitalize on new market opportunities. Despite the near-term challenges, the long-term fundamentals that drive our industry have not materially changed. While there are early indicators of improvement in some of our markets, the prolonged negative economic environment and in particular, the high levels of general unemployment persists in creating constraints on our business. Third, we are streamlining our business model, including our operational and cost structure to improve our margins and profitability as the market resumes growth. As the overall economy improves and probably more importantly, their perception of the future economic environment improves, we anticipate healthcare professionals will return to part-time work in retirement, resulting in increased demand for temporary assignments and supply. These costs are expected to grow at a slower pace than revenue as the business rebounds, which will provide positive operating leverage in the future. Nursing orders are continuing to grow and the year-over-year gap is narrowing. Although hospitals continue to focus on physician recruitment as a strategic part of their growth initiatives, in 2009, they have been relying more on their internal hiring of physicians in order to lower their costs. The result is that for the third quarter, we are reporting unallocated corporate overhead totaling $3.8 million as compared to $8.2 million for the same period in the prior year, a decline of 54%. In addition, through efficiency improvements and careful expense management, the team was able to grow operating income year-over-year.","Jeffrey Marc Silber BMO Capital Markets U.S. Are you seeing any impact on your specific business in terms of your supply pipeline? Yes we have seen increased bookings over those months as well, but not to the same magnitude as we've seen orders increase. Albert J. William Rice Soleil Securities Corporation And then as you look ahead to next year, is there any reason to think it's materially different than 35%? And every five years, the federal government in particular, the military, goes through a recontracting process where they award new contracts to, in this case, have underutilized, disadvantaged on that. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director There is still a bit of a discrepancy and that orders have actually been sequentially ticking up for six months now. Is there any of that dynamic going on with the quality of the orders? It usually takes a few months for the supply to respond and be willing to book into those. But in addition to that, we just have fewer clients with open orders today. Is there any dynamic around the quality of the orders? We feel all of these orders are very real and very placeable. In fact, if you look at where the order growth is occurring, they're very -- in attractive places, California, Florida, even Arizona which has been very quiet for the last several years is picking up, D.C., Texas. But is this -- you did talk about orders stabilizing more than bookings. When I hear you say that the orders are picking up but we're having a little divergence with the placements, sort of the actual bookings, I'm trying to understand what that means. What will happen to a small degree is as we have other sub-contractors placed through us, we will be booking a net revenue figure from the revenue that we collect but then as we turn around and pay those sub-contractors, there's a small gain that we'll have. So we have always seen this lag as the market rebounds. Bary G. Bailey Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer The $1.5 million was the result of a settlement associated with a cash hold back we had when we acquired the MHA operations. Is there still a discrepancy there between orders and bookings due to all the factors that you cited? Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director The impact in terms of our ability to recruit more supply? Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director No, I wouldn't call it a quality issue. And since they were holding the cash and this will impact the number of other of our competitors as well. But it takes a while to translate that into increased bookings. Or is there a material decline in the number of hospitals that are even accepting travel nurses at all, if you follow what I'm saying. But that will be offset by cost that we have to have in place in infrastructure in order to support that vendor management, kind of master vendor position. Albert J. William Rice Soleil Securities Corporation If we took your 10% to 15% down sequentially and we take, let's be more optimistic, say 10% down, we hold your gross margin flat and your SG&A down $2 million to $3 million sequentially. Albert J. William Rice Soleil Securities Corporation And then just on the orders and just to make sure we understand, because, I think, we're all trying to get our arms around -- I know, you got a lot of constituencies. I would guess that in this kind of environment, the easy position is to fill, get filled quickly by local people and the ones that are always hard to fill, you're getting someone to go to North Dakota, in the middle of the winter, ends up never getting filled and that sort of stays out there as an open order. That is a very large adjustment and whether you call that ongoing operations or not, that is a very unusual type of relationship. But they also realize in order to maintain the recruitment of quality clinicians, they need to have a price that supports a competitive pay rate. So I think as the market rebounds, you will see fewer players and probably more larger players getting a greater part of the market share. And so we don't see they're being a material impact there. Now the other factor is, yes, you are right, they are the more challenging orders to fill being ICU, Pediatrics, ER, NICQ. You do have a lag time, from the time you start to see orders pick up in a meaningful way, till healthcare professionals start to believe that, that order growth is going to be sustainable."

We are already seeing the results of their proactive and collaborative efforts and we want to thank them so much. From the client's perspective, the combination instantly improved our ability to offer a broader and deeper array of workforce solutions and it has noticeably increased our ability to deliver the largest supply of local and national clinicians. The balance of the decrease is a result of increased activity, but at the lower bill- pay spread. For the third quarter, operating cash flow reflects a use of cash of $15 million due primarily to the acquisition and financing cost related to the acquisition that were not capitalized as part of the transaction, which combined totaled $11.5 million. As we've communicated with you before, our target is to achieve at least $2 million in incremental annualized EBITDA from these increased direct fill synergies by the fourth quarter of next year. In both cases, Home Healthcare providers can play a significant role in the patient care delivery chain. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, revenue increased 3%, reflecting the impact of a 4% increase in days filled for the AMN business, offset by a shift in demand in the quarter to lower-priced specialties. The sequential increase is due to the $6.3 million in costs incurred associated with the acquisition for legal, accounting, operational due diligence and integration cost I previously mentioned. Unallocated overhead, excluding stock-based compensation in the third quarter was $12.6 million, up from $7 million in the preceding quarter and up from $3.7 million in the same period in the prior year. In the third quarter, the Nurse and Allied business generated $93 million in revenues, which included 5% organic growth compared with the prior quarter. The Medfinders Nurse and Allied business for the month of September added $14 million in revenue for the quarter and generated gross margin at 28%. The prior quarter included about $1.1 million in such cost and as a result, unallocated overhead was essentially flat. Our growth should be a good sign that the overall market growth is soon to come and there is strong agreement in the industry and among analyst that the long-term demand and supply dynamics of the Physician Staffing business are still quite strong. For example, in just the two months since the companies have been combined, we have doubled and in some places, nearly tripled our travel nurse direct fill rates and placements at key MSP accounts. This growth is being fueled by the increasing benefit of our Managed Services offerings and our strong client relationships. Another significant piece of the cross synergies will come from the consolidation of the travel nurse and allied operations and implementation of a shared service model. From a team member perspective, I have been very impressed with how quickly and collaboratively our teams have come together. Days filled volumes increased organically by 4% in the quarter, with modest increases across all specialties and the strongest gain being in primary care. Acute-care facilities are focusing more on the transition of patients to a quality recovery setting to avoid readmit. While our markets are still relatively constrained, we are pleased with our team's ability to build our market share and deliver industry leading growth. Since we have already communicated quite extensively on the acquisition of Medfinders and the related issuance of equity and the amendment and extension of our credit facility, I will leave any discussion regarding this to the Q&A and refer you to materials provided to the SEC and on our website. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Orders during the third quarter continue to be above prior year levels and what's encouraging is that we have seen similar growth in orders at our MSP clients and our traditional travel nurse clients non- MSPs across the country. The biggest driver of this increase continues to be in the rehab therapy specialties which have the greatest demand-supply imbalance. Our Travel Nurse business produced the greatest growth with 6% sequential increases in volume and revenue. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and other periodic reports, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. Through the acquisition, the company added a new reporting segment, Home Healthcare services, which generated revenue of $5 million for the month of September and $500,000 in operating income for the same period. AMN is now solidly the leading provider of exclusive managed services contracts, which gives us an important platform and credibility to deliver innovative workforce solutions that integrate into our clients’ processes and help them to improve their efficiencies. With these complimentary strengths, the company can now increase its collective direct fill rates across MSP clients. At the same time, healthcare providers are coming together to coordinate patient care to improve outcomes and efficiencies. The total number of client facilities with orders also continues to show sequential increases reflecting another positive demand indicator. This is a direct and immediate benefit for our clients from our stronger capabilities. This made it challenging for them to fill the travel nurse needs at many of their MSP clients.","So fourth quarter appears to be producing what is a typical seasonal trend, projecting to be down I mentioned kind of mid single digits that's very typical for the fourth quarter. But we do expect operating cash flow to turn. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director As I mentioned, earlier in the call, we've done well through the year, our team has done very well I think in the continuing constrained market and we've shown some good growth, 8% sequential growth in the second quarter, 3% in the third. Incorporated, Research Division When we think about the SG&A that you were running for the month, is that a -- is the $8 million in projected savings -- would that go up against that $6 million a month SG&A run rate? Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Yes, we've largely completed that process this week and besides the back office corporate functions, which is the bulk of the cost savings and there are some obvious immediate areas such as insurance where you can get more purchasing power and elimination of brokers, but there's also back office, corporate functions. On top of that, we have new clients, some great ones that have been signed just in the last two months, as well as a very robust pipeline of clients for the future. And then on-call and overtime is down. But overall, I would say we have the most capacity in our Locums and our nurse staffing teams. Now we can keep that in-house, increase our direct fill rates, and drive revenue just within the clients we already have. Bary G. Bailey Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer Again, I would expect that to turn fairly rapidly as the business grows dramatically, in which case you'll start seeing your AR grow, but I don't see that happening with the significant inflection points so we would expect that operating cash flow to start growing. And that's been our secret sauce for quite sometime now over the last six or seven years at Medfinders and combined with AMN, we really might have a much more powerful story. I think we feel pretty strongly not only about what we've seen just happen in the first couple of months, but the pipeline of new accounts and wins. But the rest of the year, Searches were up very nicely and we were more challenged with placements, both the supply and the ability for us to have enough trained recruiters. Bary G. Bailey Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer Cash from operations. There's still room to continue to build volumes because as much as say, recruiter productivity and revenue per recruiter and our nursing business has grown very nicely, it's still not back to where it was even three or four years ago. Where we have others such as in Perm placement where we may have a region where we have recruiters that are at 60% of capacity. As I mentioned, we've already seen our direct fill rates at the MSPs begin to go up in just the first two months, in fact double and triple in some accounts. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director And what Bob's talking about there is the pipeline of new contracts and some might be existing clients where we have some business, but moving them from a kind of traditional competitive account situation where we might have just sort of normal or even low market share to a MSP where we have a much higher fill rate and can dramatically increase our market share overall. Incorporated, Research Division How much excess capacity would you say you have across the system? And that's the other thing that I mentioned in our comments, that the market seems to be okay, a little bit of weakness recently on Searches, but it's also challenging when you're in an uncertain market environment to recruit and retain really strong, productive, talented recruiters and marketers because if they're not clear about where the industry is going, they may want to try something different. If you don't have any unallocated -- any of the unallocated corporate overhead attributed to it, then that will have an impact on it, yes. Albert J. William Rice Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division So certainly by the first quarter you think you'll be back to cash flow positive on a cash flow from operations basis? You can't call them out per se because they're not discrete, but we do expect operating cash flow to start to present itself just as we've reflected from our EBITDA we would expect to start seeing that grow. Our expectation is to use cash from operations. I think the industry is projecting some growth next year. Albert J. William Rice Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division Well your $50 negative and your cash flow from operations, this quarter, did I hear you right, you said that there was $11.5 million of unusual items in there? Those are contracts that we already have in- house and we were sending some of their needs out to subcontractors because we, AMN, didn't have per diem capabilities where Medfinders didn't have a big enough travel nurse capability so they were having -- we were collectively having to send a fair amount of business out to subs. And so we're feeling very confident about our ability to achieve, not only the cost synergies which are very well documented and planned and we've got people and processes in place to achieve those, but really the revenue synergies that give us longer-term opportunity to drive profitability and grow the business. We're explaining to the client why this is a good thing to do and with the support of a really good product and service offering, we're able to convince them to move to an exclusive relationship, where we then use our sub-contractor network to fill all their orders. There isn't a lot of excess capacity there. The $0.09 is in the financing cost which is an interest expense as a result of the amendment and extension, a significant portion of the cost associated with that are charged off directly and they flow through interest expense. Incorporated, Research Division And then with regards to the CapEx and the additional integration expenses, can you talk a little bit more about that as we think through the free cash flow characteristics over the next six months? That's not included in the direct fill rates and the $20 million plus that I was referring to earlier. For example, we've already closed – just since the combination of the two companies together, each of us had a pipeline and we were able to put them together and identify some immediate opportunities not only to close some business, but we actually had a couple of situations, one in particular, where the client, because of this acquisition felt that this was the choice they should make and they already -- we've already had a win in that respect as well. In the quarter, with the acquisition and the bringing together of the two companies, there's a lot of cost flowing through. Bary G. Bailey Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer I'm trying to think of the unallocated corporate overhead. So not only into what we think will be some uplift in this next quarter, but really in the next year, throughout the full year, we think that there will be a significant increase in our number of wins and number of clients, where we can take advantage of both the travel side, expanded travel capabilities as well as now providing per diem. That would be just in your SG&A and is also reflected in unallocated overhead in the segment reporting. That's about a $1.5 million, $2 million of negative cash flow from ops and then you got the $1 million of CapEx, is that going to turnaround pretty quickly?"

The sequential increase in SG&A of about $2 million was related to several factors: first, we completed the wind down of operations in our U.K. office, which resulted in about $400,000 of one-time costs in the quarter. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and other periodic reports which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. The report points out that this growth in demand is at odds with the workforce supply constraints such as the aging clinical population itself, a preference by younger professionals to work fewer hours, and the lack of additional capacity in the education and training systems. These recent wins reflect continued opportunity for future market share gains and recognition of our stronger value proposition and fulfillment capabilities. These trends are temporarily being masked by the uncertain and challenging economic environment but they will become increasingly evident as the macro factors improve and the magnitude of the demand growth simply overtakes the already stretched capacity of the workforce. We are making greater efforts and progress to partner with these clients to augment their internal efforts and we are working hard to attract supply through more innovative social media channels. Also, excluding the impairment charge from the calculation of pre-tax income our full year cash tax rate is anticipated to be less than 20% due to utilization of the NOLs that came with the Medfinders acquisition. This is driven largely by the continued aging demographic shift and the increased utilization created by healthcare reform. With these trends in sight we continue to evolve our business model and our service offerings to help our clients to deal with this increasing challenge of access to talent, workforce planning and simultaneously reducing costs. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. The shortfall came primarily from lower than expected fill rates as well as softer than expected demand in behavioral health and radiology. As the recent federal and state regulatory and reimbursement changes have had a more severe than expected impact on our home health business and the entire industry, we’ve lowered our near-term projections for the home healthcare segment which prompted us to perform an impairment test during Q3. The report lays out the daunting equation of expected 23% growth in healthcare jobs from 2008 until 2018, which contrasts with the significantly slower-growing workforce supply. The quality and the quantity of our available assignments has improved the opportunity for nurses to take repeat assignments with us, and this has translated into improving rebook rates. Our larger national network of candidates and the very important affiliate vendors we work with are also critical during a time of growing demand and tight supply of candidates. The year-over-year growth was driven primarily by increased fill rates at new and existing MSP clients. Our Locum Tenens segment revenue increased by 1% from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in days filled. AMN will continue to own and utilize the Nursefinders brand name for our local staffing and franchise operations. The sequential improvement was driven primarily by an increase in productivity by the Allied Team now that the integration is fully behind us. Our local staffing offices continue to be a contributor to our success in winning and filling MSP business. We also experienced modest sequential Q3 increases in supply. In addition to our focus on improving fill rates, we believe there is also opportunity to improve bill rates and to expand gross margin across most of our Locum specialties. This increasing growth in demand for healthcare professionals was revalidated by the recently-published bipartisan Health Project Report which was on future challenges in healthcare workforce planning. Unallocated overhead, excluding stock compensation and integration expenses, in Q3 was $7.5 million, consistent with the prior quarter and higher than the prior year expense of $6.4 million. In addition to attracting new supply of candidates into the travel industry, an important part of expanding our available candidate pool is through extensions and repeat travelers. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter and projected full year, which excludes the charges associated with the impairment, integration, and credit facility amendment, is approximately 56%. As of today, travel nurse orders are still up approximately 50% year-over-year and have been relatively steady since Q3. Q3 operating cash flow was $4.9 million and days sales outstanding were 55 days compared to 54 days in the last quarter.","What are you seeing in terms of the supply out there and is there any pressure in terms of pay rates? In our current candidate database we have over 20,000 people who’ve traveled with us before who are currently in perm roles, and the ability to attract them back into the industry is what will really drive future growth as well as new supply who’s never traveled before. And then again, our systems have been set up to be able to scale up very quickly without adding the direct expenses. We don’t go just for general applicants because there’s a lot of nurses out there that just don’t travel well or we can’t place on travel assignments, so our focus is on those individuals that match up to client order requirements. It’s been operated as a separate unit, if I remember correctly. So if we implemented a contract October 1st, for example, a good number of the people working in Q4 were already booked before October 1; and so we’re just starting to pick up the new orders and the new business. Jeffrey Marc Silber BMO Capital Markets U.S. Just a follow-up on the last question regarding supply, Ralph, you had mentioned trying to increase pay rates to entice nurses to travel. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director The census and admission levels have been sort of a non-impact on our volume and demand for probably the last couple of years to be honest, just as we’ve seen rebound in our orders and census has remained relatively stagnant or even gone slightly backwards from year to year. So in the travel nurse business for now we are feeling like the increases in candidate supply are keeping up with the increases in order demand on the client side. It’s been a lot of pressure, a lot of overtime. Jeffrey Marc Silber BMO Capital Markets U.S. And in Q1, assuming the deal goes through, is this going to be recognized as discontinued operations then? And the reason for that is because we know that it is hard to fill some of these difficult assignments. There’s still pretty low vacancy across the overall industry but we’ve seen more stabilization in our average daily rent costs as well as in our vacancies, which is very critical to make sure that we don’t have any open rooms and spending where we aren’t generating revenue. Although we still have capacity in travel nursing our recruiters have just done a stellar job and their productivity is up considerably there’s still capacity and room for that to grow more, but we want to make sure that we have the bench strength and new star recruiters coming in behind them as well. And then how should we think about the VMS projects in terms of how quickly they’ll roll on? And then can you talk a little bit about, as we look forward, how you think about the incremental margins flowing through? And obviously being almost twice as large as our closest competitor, we have a very large capability to deliver on that and they know that. Almost entirely all of these wins and other wins that we’ve had pretty much throughout this year have been focused on clients who really are frustrated in the fill rates -- not being able to get their orders filled in a timely fashion. And all of that accrues to a more profitable overall operation for us in the long run. And the good news I think about those 2 cities is they’re less constrained on the rent side than we’ve seen in California, so to kind of put those 2 questions together, California is probably the market that’s having the biggest issue with rent. And that really has far overshadowed their big focus on bill rates, because frankly we’ve been able to get some improved rates not only from our existing clients but even as we’ve set up these new clients. And so we find that in these conversations it’s actually far less about bill rates and even financial terms, although everyone’s always cognizant of that, but it’s more about “How can you meet my needs?” And in this market where demand is rising across the country and supply is tight, they want to work with a primary player that has a strong database of candidates and the ability to deliver on that supply when they need it. They understand the correlation between getting their jobs filled and bill and pay rates, and so we just kind of work with them to set those at the appropriate levels. But right now they can because of the labor market. I’m just wondering how easy is it divested from total operations? Are there any other things your company is doing in order to alleviate that issue? But we have begun to see an increase in the number of unique candidates with kind of the difficult- to-fill specialties which is where we target all of our spending efforts. I think a difference that we’re seeing is that we are having even more demand in the higher unique specialty areas that are always going to be challenging to fill regardless of where your census is. Ralph S. Henderson President of Professional Services & Staffing What I would probably add is that you’re seeing an increased utilization, kind of a strategic utilization of staffing in the hospital environments where hospitals, because of the census fluctuation, now realize that they need to depend a little bit more on temporary help type solutions to staff their hospitals up and down as the census fluctuates. Hospitals have been trying to keep their costs down and I think we’ve done a good job of trying to educate them, frankly especially in our MSP clients, to show them actually where their costs are higher when they use overtime than if they use our staff. So if you have a consolidation where you have, for instance, 2 children’s hospitals in the same market and they consolidate, utilization we’ll see go down. There’s projections out there that there will be more physicians needed, more nurses needed. But as well, when you see consolidations of some of the larger players, they’re some of the ones who actually understand the strategic benefits of travel and local staffing, and so then we see utilization tend to go up over time whenever it migrates to some of the larger players. Robert E. Livonius Former President of Strategic Workforce Solutions - AMN Healthcare Yes, the complexity of some of the mergers and then the complexity of the integration of those mergers is an area that we have some good case studies on how well we’ve helped clients to take on additional locations and merge them in, and help them actually be easier for them to do that in terms of how to set up an MSP that will encompass this new business they’ve already acquired. Do they have a lower or higher utilization of temporary services? Our Florida orders have increased, that’s good as well. We sell it as an add value with all of the advantages I think we have, like for example we own our own software and proprietary software, and things like that that we have; that we have over 400 subcontractors who have figured out how to efficiently not only bill and take orders from them but get them paid and get us paid. That’s unique to us and we think it’s a very critical part of our success with these particularly larger MSPs; as well as just your basic credentialing and operations personnel. We’re only in the diligence and analyze stage now and we certainly believe that the terms are at market in the current environment but we’ll have to wait to get further along down the path to be able to give more color on that. So not only do we need to be educating them on what’s available and the attractiveness but they need to be educating one another; that’s actually more powerful and we’re starting to see that happen more. As Ralph was just saying, really the value of temporary labor at the right level within hospital systems, and certainly a lot more business outside the acute care setting isn’t being measured the way everybody measures hospital census. So having more assignment opportunities for them, having opportunities for them to work more hours, having an assignment for them to go to after they finish this one -- all of those things I think are helping our supply trends."

We also incurred some severance costs related to ongoing back-office efficiency projects and the leadership change made in our local staffing business. Our leading industry position and overall improving financial performance is also enabling AMN to make important investments to fuel our long-term growth. With the sequential results reflecting a 1.9% decrease in days filled offset by an equal increase in revenue per day filled on higher average fill rates. We were also engaged by the client to perform consulting services, where cost savings were identified for them by addressing staffing and efficiencies. The travel nurse growth was driven by modest order growth; strong fill rates, strong rebook rates and increased sourcing spend to growth the supply of nurse candidates. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $11.5 million and capital expenditures for the third quarter were $1.5 million. Gross margin improved by 360 basis points from the prior year and 420 basis points from prior quarter mainly as a result of higher billable recruiter productivity and lower candidate sourcing cost. Our tax rate in the quarter was 42%, slightly lower than our full year and fourth quarter projected tax rate of 44%. Clients with orders and clients with clinicians on assignment were also up both, year-over-year and sequentially. And over the next year, we will also increase our technology infrastructure investment to ensure that we have a scalable, more efficient and agile platform from which to deliver best- in-class service to our clients and clinicians. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted and we wish all a speedy recovery and return to their everyday activities. We feel confident in the demand growth expected over the next few years and we believe these investments will further set us apart and enable us to more efficiently deliver the quality and quantity of clinicians our clients need. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.12. AMN has been a Novation supplier in Nurse and Allied for several years and we were named their 2011 purchase services supplier of the year for our commitment to delivering exceptional value and quality. I would like to start by thanking everyone for joining us on the call today, especially given the storm activity that occurred earlier this week. Our sales pipeline line for MSP opportunities continues to be robust. This is primarily a result of the efficiency of higher fill rates with our MSP clients, which are typically double compared to traditional accounts. The year-over-year percentage change was due to improved SG&A leverage and lower bad debt expense partly offset by the increased spending on strategic initiatives to grow candidate supply and expand our workforce solutions. The allied team continued to deliver strong fill rates, rebook rates and improvements in sales productivity. Going into the fourth quarter, strong bookings have continued and we expect to see our travel nurse volume up 20% year-over-year. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and our other filings with the SEC which are publicly available. These investments will enable us to continue building our market share, our workforce solutions capabilities and the supply of quality clinicians to meet the accelerated demand for healthcare labor that is anticipated. Becky has been with AMN for over 10 years in key sales and operational leadership roles within the travel nurse business. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, should, would, project, may, variations of such words and other similar expressions. The recruitment and availability of allied clinicians is vital to their ability to grow and deliver quality patient care. The first area of investment is in our innovative recruitment approaches centered around, mobile, online and social media technologies to aggressively drive more candidate supply. Despite lower demand and supply constraints in certain markets, the business is stabilizing. Regarding our policy on forward-looking statements, various remarks and characterizations we make during this call about future expectations, projections, plans, prospects, events or circumstances constitute forward-looking statements. The New York City hospitals are collaborating to ensure that patient care and proper staffing is their top priorities. This guidance incorporates the impact of Hurricane Sandy, including some lost revenue and the potential delay of an EMR project in the Northeast.","That was kind of last time saw any declines in the market the market then took back off again grew it throughout the year, so it's a combination of both, but we definitely seen some share increases, which is primarily a result of our MSP strategy at these levels of demand, we can feel very, very high percentages of the overall number of orders that we get. We don’t provide very much strike business we only support our MSP clients when they go into a strike and help them manage that process and keep their expenses low and remain efficient and with high quality during those times. But on average, our fill rates are little bit less than that on the nursing allied side. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director It will continue at some level Josh, and then the quarter these strategic initiatives which are primarily to drive candidate supply, but also is around expanding our workforce solutions offering and making sure that we are improving our position as that workforce solution’s innovator, and roughly 800,000 in the third quarter and it’s going to be just a tad over $1 million in the fourth quarter, and going into next year, we'll probably see it kind of continue at that pace for a quarter or 2 but a lot depends upon the results that we see, because we absolutely expect to see revenue benefit from this. So, it will be a multi-quarter process and while we might see some nice jumps from quarter-to-quarter, it won’t necessarily be a study progress. Robert E. Livonius Former President of Strategic Workforce Solutions - AMN Healthcare We think the momentum in nursing is continuing about the same pace, but the growth really is starting up in the allied side and still a smaller percentage than it is in the nursing, but also beginning to build that pipeline for locums, and starting to see some anticipation of growth in that area as well, so it's a bit of a mix change as well as just a geographic change. We find that when we are in a market and we can do multiple MSPs, the actually fill rate goes up for all of us. We are finding that there the acceptance level and understanding of how MSP can impact them just continues to grow as a result principally of the reference base, so now we have the strong support we get from Novation, and they've certainly got very large pipeline and clients who have yet to implement MSP and they are out there and trying to help us get into those client as well, so our outlook for, certainly for the next year or so is certainly very strong. I know you talked about the strategic initiative to expand future candidate supply. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director As you've heard from us in the last couple of quarters, we really believe that we have the right components and the right strategy in our business today and we are making investments to make sure that we can continue to really build that momentum in workforce solutions in particular with MSP and RPO and other kinds of solutions for our clients as well as making sure that we have the supply coming into meet the increased demand really across all of the business segment. So, in the beginning we may initially still fill more like 40% or 50%, and then over time as we get things moving and more efficient at our end then we would like to move that up to 60%, 70%, 80%. Ralph S. Henderson President of Professional Services & Staffing On the strike front slowdown in activity there, I think some of the stuff we were seeing on both coast, has really just kind of almost gone away for all intensive purpose although there is a little bit of activity we are seeing kind of in the Midwest, and some possibilities there that are more towards mid-year this year. The re-pricing we're able to in physician staffing has that unfolded into the P&L with third quarter results or is that more of a multi-quarter process with more to come? I don’t know we gave a number, but I guess we are up in the 20% to 40% range when you look at it on our supply trends. We also find that even our non-MSP clients in the same markets have higher fill rates. But at this point, we're being more conservative in our own estimates when we bring those contracts in as to what we might directly fill ourselves. What would be the differential between what would you may receive in terms of orders to kind of have in market share with a customer prior to an MSP, and then potentially what would you aspire to increase that to once an MSP has been implemented in and is maturing [ph]? Then I was wondering if you could comment about strike activity at your hospital customers and whether you are seeing kind of more of that than you have historically and if you would expect that to continue. You would start to see it taper off towards the later part of next year in terms of that candidate supply piece because some of it is truly upfront expense and investment and then whatever we have on an ongoing basis will be supported by the incremental revenue that it's driving. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director It was part of an initiative and a process that began in the fourth quarter of last year, where we really reorganized our groups and constantly put greater accountability on how we were pricing locums business and managing the gross margins, and we started to see the benefit of that in the second quarter when you saw our gross margins increased significantly and that has sustained and even improved a little further into the third quarter. There is a lot of uncertainty and our clients are feeling it in and it even affects their behavior right now in holding back until they have better clarity. And, again, use that as an opportunity to reengage with our clients, talk about why we need to have fill rates increases to cover those costs. And surprisingly also, our traditional business fill rates go up at the same time, we become kind of the source that can move to go around and find a multiple opportunity and so we can serve their kind of the entire career, right? So, I think the overall fill rates for the company will continue to probably trickle down a little while as we build that more in the nursing and the allied side, but overall the number is growing in a very positive way. But, again, it's still a fairly new model and so I think we are going to make sure that we have a strong affiliate vendor network, which we do in the nurse and allied business, because our commitment to the client is to fill more like 90% or 95%. As we said earlier on the call, right now we talk to some investments we are making really in the business, but outside of that in the excess cash flows, we’ll use continue to pay down debt. It's unclear as to whether or not you are gaining travelers from other potential players, because of your strong supply in terms of high quality client base or are you actually starting to see an improvement in terms of the behavioral trends there? I guess there was a report that one of your competitors might be looking to get rid of its medical staffing business, and I wondered if you had any thoughts about consolidation activity in the States. In markets where we have multiple MSPs, our fill rates on those MSPs are higher when we have multiple MSPs. Even after this quarter, we are seeing about 6 weeks of an increasing trend in our orders, so we are feeling like demand is beginning to pick back up again. Then just maybe lastly on technical question on the working capital fluctuation, I know you had a big cash flow quarter last quarter and you had a good cash flow this one, but it wasn't quite as much as last quarter and it seems like that's receivables bouncing around. As Susan mentioned, we're making some investments in both, our supply acquisition as well some of our core infrastructure. Maybe that you'll think 90% plus of the orders that we get, so obviously want to sell as much as we can directly, but to the extent we can't, we then use our subcontractors. But assuming all in, we complete the projects that we have our slate. Ralph S. Henderson President of Professional Services & Staffing When you talk about our direct, is what obviously our fill rate overall with the clients. We are working very collaboratively with our clients in New York City. That’s partly because we are bringing more nurses to the market ourselves, so while there may be some client concern as we go through the sale cycle, we always want to try to go back to the client again and show them examples where that's actually potentially to their benefit. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director I think to be quite honest, Tobey, it's a little early to tell what that top potential direct fill rate might be with locums, because we've just signed our first locums MSPs in the last few months. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer The fill rates haven't been that high in nursing allied, so I don't think we've ever quoted 80% or 90% in terms of fill rates, but our fill rates depending up on the maturity of the account can get to that level after you get to a point where 6 months, nine months into it and then certainly in that second, third year. But again, those are so severe that I have to believe that they will be addressed, and so on the probable fronts, we don’t see anything that we would have a material effect on our business and the trajectory of where we think that we are going. And as you saw in the fourth quarter, we are actually looking to pick up our momentum year-over-year because of just the strength of the model that we have there, it's certainly an outcrop of our strengthened MSP relationships that we have and our ability to continue to fill more in those and add more of those contracts, but it's also within the traditional non-MSP business that we've seen order growth and our ability to increase our traveler account in the number of clients with open order, so I would just say that the travel nurse all around is probably outperforming certainly the market, but also the normal seasonal trend. And, so we'll be able to calibrate our continued spending depending on the returns that we're seeing particularly around the candid applications and supply. It's going to take that in order to get our EBITDA margins where we believe they can and should be. We are more weighted in the government business for example, which tends to have lower margins, but that's part of what Ralph and our leadership team are addressing within the locums business is to overtime adjust our mix to be more weighted in the higher growth areas and not to be cause any over weighted in any particular specialty that might be susceptible to declines in the future. So, if you're average locum fill rate is normally in the 40% to 50% range, we would hope that we could get that to 70% or 80%, which should be comparable to the nursing business."

As healthcare providers navigate through a climate of weaker census and budgetary pressures, they are seeking trusted partners, who can enable them to create more flexible workforce models, that also help them achieve their patient care and financial goals. And the third is the streamlining of our systems and infrastructure for greater efficiency, scalability and agility. The second is our leading-edge recruitment technology, such as job distribution and mobile platforms, to aggressively attract more candidate supply and create a better experience. Some will work and some won’t, but the common goal is to improve the overall value equation of cost and quality of care. The year-over-year decrease is due to the relative softness in demand and the sequential decline is due to fewer EMR conversion projects, which is very typical during the holidays, and offset the growth, which was in our traditional travel nurse business. Our RPO program was recently recognized by HRO Today, as ranked #1 in their inaugural healthcare Baker's Dozen Award for outstanding quality and customer service. Fourth quarter interest expense will be $1.8 million, and capital expenditures are projected to be $4 million. Throughout October however, orders have strengthened and have generally been above prior year levels and are up nearly 20% over the prior month. To address the reimbursement challenges in therapy, our resources have been realigned and the team is focused on expanding our MSP footprint, increasing fill rates, and targeting the less impacted acute care and home health settings. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, planned, will, should, would, project, may, variations of such words and other similar expressions. The strong cash flow was driven in part by improved receivable collections, along with higher accrued compensation and other payables, due to timing of our quarter close date relative to our normal payment cycles. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $26.6 million. Overall days available grew by 10% over the prior year, helping to fuel the growth. Our MSP revenue mix in Locums is still in the single digits, but we expect the penetration of Locums' MSP to increase, which is evidenced by our growing pipeline. A common ingredient in every care model is efficient utilization of a quality, appropriately skilled healthcare workforce. So while we feel good about our current overall performance, our sights are set on the future, and how we will continue to create innovative workforce solutions with our clients and improve our profitability through efficiency and scale. We continue to make important investments in our people, processes, technology and potential new products and services. Based on new client wins and search activity, we expect fourth quarter Physician Perm revenue to be up in the mid-single digits year-over-year, and down slightly sequentially, which is a very typical seasonal trend. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and our other filings with the SEC, which are publicly available. Regarding our policy on forward-looking statements, various remarks and characterizations we make during this call about future expectations, projections, plans, prospects, events or circumstances constitute forward-looking statements. The closer relationships and the higher fill rates we achieve through MSP contracts enables us to grow faster during periods of market expansion and provide some protection during periods of demand softness.","So we really think it's driven the appetite for more workforce solutions and MSPs because, it not only gives them greater flexibility, but it gives them better analytics to really understand how, when and where they're hiring workforce, and how they can be more efficient in their utilization. And it speaks to the trend of how our orders declined in the end of the second quarter, early third quarter, and then as I mentioned, have strengthened more from September to October. Can you talk a little bit with regards to what you're seeing in terms of fill rates? Are you seeing the fill rates pick up materially? There weren’t any material onetime items in the quarter. But where it's an identified project, and we're really implementing our full management program, that’s kind of where we get kind of the $5 million run rate number from. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Well, some of it is because of what we've seen in the demand itself, mentioning that orders started to increase. First, we know bookings did bottom out in May, kind of June, and then we've seen an upward trend since then as the order counts came back up. So kind of order of magnitude, I think we're looking around the table saying, maybe it was $1 million or $2 million, at the most. As I think about the orders picking up on a year-over-year basis in the nurse travel subsegment, just how that -- obviously there's a long lead time between orders and finding and filling and then actually getting the contract started. An interesting phenomena, when people are watching their budgets, they sometimes place an order that they don’t really fulfill on. It’s just more and more frequent that we have conversations where clients are changing their workforce strategy to include a higher percentage of contingent labor, just for times like these. And just lastly, can you talk about the acquisition pipeline and your appetite to make any deals? Things like case management, managers, or patient care coordinators, who help hospitals become more efficient in how they manage their patient volumes and to slow down readmissions. When demand is stronger, I think they'll help our fill rate improve quite a bit, and we won’t have kind of that headwind of demand -- or just cautiousness by the hospitals right now. I don’t know that we want to call out a particular client situation, but definitely a trend, and it’s a small one, but one that we're seeing is clients moving towards -- or at least, voicing the desire to move towards lower core staffing levels, so that they can create a more flexible workforce for the future. Additionally, conversations with our clients have been that the reductions that they've put in place have begun to take a toll, their overtime costs and their burn-up factors go up, and so those conversations tend to lead to higher order counts very shortly thereafter. Our fill rates have been -- they're up on MSP, but they're pretty steady overall. And that of course hurts our fill rate. Could you describe what you think the percentage of flexible staff is at your customers currently? But the things that we continue to hear, for 2014 and beyond, is that they need to be prepared for a potential spike and uptick in demand and utilization, and that’s driving more desire to partner with us and others within the industry in things like MSP. And just a final point is, I think that the industry itself, people think of it as an industry where there's a lot of small clients, maybe only use 2 or 3 vendors, and maybe they only need 2 or 3 doctors a year, while there's a lot of clients who have somewhere between 10 million, 20 million and 30 million, and in fact, our pipeline in Locum’s right now has doubled. Can you give us some sort of order of magnitude how large that business is for you, the EMR business? They don’t necessarily call them flu orders. They changed their mind after they've placed the order and then the order gets shut down and our fill rates. So we expect Q1 to get back to kind of a normal level of EMRs in the pipeline. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director We certainly believe so, and based on the pipeline of MSPs that we have and the momentum we have right now in the business, I would expect to. And in fact from September to October, our orders increased almost 20%. I think order of magnitude, it gave us a little bit more in local staffing in particular, which is a smaller business for us, and a little bit more in Nursing. Which is very good for us, performed very well in filling in home health specialties. But those industries have tended to adjust and they're kind of hitting that cycle. And we did see the slight increase on orders overall, Q3 versus Q2. And really it’s not what we're seeing in the pipeline. So we would expect that penetration to go up over time, which coincides exactly with what clients are saying to us, that they want to move towards lower core staff and more flexible staff. I think we will -- it may ebb and flow a little bit as we continue to make investments in that business. Actually, going back to even July and August, we mentioned on our second quarter call that we were beginning to see our seasonal orders, and that was a good sign, and that trend continued. Additionally, we're seeing some hospitals begin to upgrade technologies that are older, dated, and so we're seeing next-generation things. And so as we look at our volumes, they've also strengthened, which actually October being the biggest gap year-over-year, and that narrowing to where in December, we're currently projecting to be basically flat, year-over-year. So again, I don’t know that I can -- I apologize I'm not answering specifically about a client, but definitely hearing more clients talk about that desire to have more flexibility in their workforce. And utilization is very high in home health. And you know, admittedly, it’s hard to parse it out, because we don’t always know for certain why we get the order, and what the uplift was for. In that business, the decline in orders has begun to slow down. And we have clients who are looking to not staff up and instead just use flexible labor to meet their census peaks and valleys. It doubled last quarter, it doubled again this quarter, and represents over 25% of the total pipeline of prospects. So just getting the technology installed and then giving it up to meaningful use, there are several different projects that occur along the way. It's a little bit hard to segment out exactly the total for that business, because oftentimes, clients just place orders as traditional travel orders that are part of that EMR project. Timothy John McHugh William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division I just wanted to ask about the time that the bookings kind of bottomed in May or June. It is priced as value-added offering, so we do not try to go in at a low rate in order to get the business. But aren’t most of those projects done? Actually, we have opportunities that run clear through 2015 in our current pipeline."

To that point just since January our orders are up about 20% and the number of units with orders is also up 20%, and the number of facilities with orders is up about 8%. The biggest driver of growth in 2007 came from our locum tenens staffing segment which produced 16% year-over-year growth in revenue. Another contributor to the lower nurse volumes was the impact of a bottleneck immigration environment and the affect on our international nurse staffing division O'Grady Peyton. These decreases are due to continued payments from our cash flow to reduce our debt outstanding. We're optimistic that this issue will be resolved in the long-term as foreign educated nurses are significant source of staffing for healthcare facilities nationwide. However, we must continue to innovate and remained agile in order to further expand our leadership position. As I mentioned, our nurse and allied staffing segments started out relatively strong during the first half of 2007, but did not produce the expected seasonal volume increases during the third and fourth quarters. We are cautiously optimistic as demand trends including some of the states that I mentioned have improved over the past month and we seem to be on track to close the year- over-year gap. AMN also received the top scores in terms of our capability to fill needs quickly, customer responsiveness, reputation and trust, and competitive pricing. Revenue generated by our locum tenens staffing segment this quarter was 76 million, an increase of 12% compared to last year and a decrease of 8% from last quarter. Revenue generated by our nurse and allied health care staffing segment this quarter was a 197 million compared to 202 million last year, and 204 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in revenue was due mainly to a decrease in days filled. The overall demand and supply trends remain strong and we are again expecting locum tenens staffing to be our fastest growing segment during 2008. While we do not have enough supply to fill demand, the supply of new providers is growing at a healthy pace driven in part by the demographic factors of an ageing physician population and a generational shift towards part time work among younger physicians. If we get release sooner great, but in the meantime we've taken steps to restructure our operations to align our business with the lower international volume we’re forecasting. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. The year-over-year increase in revenue was due to a 4% increase in days filled combined with an 8% increase in revenue per day sales. AMN Healthcare's strong commitment to high quality and superior client service is an important differentiator, and we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. While we did produce efficiencies in operations, these were partially offset particularly during the first half of the year by direct cost pressures causing diluted earnings per share to grow at a slower rate of 3% to a $1.05. Clients ranked AMN significantly more favorable than our nearest competition in a number of key areas such as nurse quality and experience, contribution towards improved patient outcomes and clinical excellence. Well, in aggregate, travel nurse demand has been below prior year levels, we still have more open orders than we have travelers coming off assignment each month. We are known first and foremost for the high quality professionals we place, but we are also recognized as being the most capable of helping Healthcare providers to manage the clinical labor needs. Turning to our financial position, this quarter we generated 25 million in operating cash flow and $80 million for the full year, which in addition to cash on hand was used to reduce debt outstanding by 27 million for the year and to repurchase one million shares of stock in the third quarter.","I think we draft kind of early in January, and as I mentioned, the positive news is we have seen a very nice recovery in our orders over the last month to the tune almost a 20% increase from January to February. The biggest typical seasonal trend is to see the orders building in the summer for your fall placements and if you recall, that's what we didn't see last year. And, can you give some idea of where in the spectrum of recovery you would need to get to in order to kind of hit the numbers that you put out, not so much in the first quarter which is almost over, but in the second, third and fourth quarters? <strong>Susan Nowakowski</strong> Yes I think that has been contributing to the increase in orders in fact, as we post our clients and ask them why there orders are going up. <strong>David Dreyer</strong> No, that was, I mean, we downsized both, mostly building, but also people in order to more or less operate at this current level. So, we feel pretty optimistic that we can grow market share within the existing environment. With respect to the economy and the employment market, overtime a more difficult employment environment we've talked about that on many occasions, and a more difficult employment environment could lead to nurses going back to work. The growth in the quarter was, I guess, a little bit slower than what we have been projecting. So it remains to be seen whether that normal trend will happen or whether the build up in orders we see will allow us to control beyond that. Can you give us some order of magnitude how large those states are as of percentage of revenues, percentage of travelers and anything you could help that would be appreciative? I mean, clearly we’ve got the business fairly efficient. You mentioned the issues in terms of California, Arizona, and Florida, and how they've rebounded a bit occurring quarter. And quite honestly, how long some of them will hang on; you know part of the reason we need a very talented staff to remain on, even though we are not making a lot of new placements is to keep that pipeline fresh and engaged and ready to go. So as we look at the declines from third to fourth quarter, I would say they were pretty well spread across all the specialties, although, those that are more susceptible to actual closing such as, surgeries were a little bit harder hip, but that should be expected in the government business load at a slightly greater rate than the private business. Once we have the floodgates open with visas available, we'll start putting them through the system and it will take anywhere from four to six months depending upon where they were in the process to get them placed."

The consistent need for quality physicians to drive revenue and margin at healthcare facilities helps provide a more sustainable demand environment than experienced by permanent placement companies in other industries. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. To this end, we have taken a number of steps to ensure we achieve operational efficiencies and are the right size to accommodate the decline in travel, nursing, and allied orders. During the earnings call of one of the major hospital systems, they mentioned that they will “continue to protect the labor at the bedside,” and that they will need more nurses next year than this year to take care of increasing volume level. During the first quarter, order levels have slowed from most our business lines, most significantly with nurse and allied. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result the various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, and our current reports on Form 8-K, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. In the fourth quarter, we also began to experience a drop in overall allied orders, although less significant than the drop in nursing. The company generated $14 million of operating cash flow during the fourth quarter which when combined with $7 million of net cash on hand and $7 million of revolver draw downs during the quarter, were used primarily to pay estimated taxes and reduced debt. Pricing is stable across most of our business lines, helping to maintain gross margins. While orders are significantly down, we believe we still have about twice as many assignments to offer than our closest competitors. We are working very hard to ensure that we can flex our operating model in the short term while at the same time making the appropriate investments to be well positioned and innovative in the long term, and with that, we would now like to open up the call to your questions. Our aggregate days-filled volume improved 2% year over year and our revenue per day filled contributed the other 2%. In our allied division, we are positioned well in the long-term to serve the staffing disciplines that are projected to be the fastest growing, such as rehab therapy, laboratory, and pharmacy. During 2008, we launched 3 important new service offerings including recruitment process outsourcing and staffing services in the home health market and ambulatory surgery centers. Specifically, we were rated particularly high as having an excellent reputation, being easy to work with, being innovative, and filling assignments quickly. First, capturing more market share by leveraging our client base; second, proactively adjusting our cost structure and capturing additional productivity gains; and finally pursuing further penetration in emerging market opportunities and client segments. Some competitors are forced to turn away high-quality candidates in today’s market because they just don’t have enough assignments to offer. The sequential decline was the result of a 9% decrease in days filled volume. Fortunately, AMN Healthcare’s 24-year history and strong leadership position show our proven ability to strike this balance better than others in our field. The company continues to focus on its collection efforts to drive strong cash flow.","In fact, one of the largest utilizers of travel nurses across the country just decreased the number of vendors by about 50%, so it’s a real opportunity for us to really solidify our position and in some cases actually gain a preferred status where they are willing to give us the orders ahead of the competition. The things that we think can help us are the market share and the fact that we ought to be able to provide more assignments to more candidates to hopefully maintain and grow more of our piece of the business. We provide a premium service, and for that, charged probably a higher price than your typical contingency type of firm, so we hope that in this environment, we will be able to maintain that pricing, but there could of course be some opportunity there for softness. Are you going to be changing your pricing strategy in order to keep doing that? It is hard to quantify, but there may be a bit of pent-up demand there that could be relieved when they start to see better cash flows themselves. Still, as I mentioned earlier, we have to be out in front of the clients continuing to sell the value that we bring to the table so that we can make sure we maintain our pricing. If there are projects that we were working on that would maybe require us to go outside of the company for particular expertise in, and we’ve certainly skinned back the number of projects that we’re working on within the company, which then translates through to needing less services externally, and this is really across the board. You have $11 million in cash, and it looks to me in the fourth quarter, your free cash flow was about $12 million, and I guess we don’t know what it is, but you look for to being lower at least in the first half than that. The other thing that we’re seeing in some of these areas like anesthesia where you have a group of physicians that are providing services to the facilities is if their overall income is down whether it be their own investment or just availability of work, they are less likely to bring a locum in to help augment because they need the income themselves, so we’re seeing some doctors that might have historically taken time off even over the holidays just stay put in order to make sure they preserve their own income, and that eats into a little bit of the demand. When you look at the total revenue declines that you expect in the first quarter, and your comments that locum tenens and physician are relatively stable, when you flow that through the numbers, we are talking about a pretty dramatic decline in nursing allied, approaching 20% both sequentially and year over year. Susan Nowakowski It is something we are hearing from our clients somewhat across board that they actually have needs and demands, but they are having to conserve all operating cash to continue to proceed with maybe some capital projects, whether they be equipment or building related, so there may be a bit. I mentioned that we’re very selectively replacing positions where people may be leaving the organization, so I would expect that there could be some further opportunity there, and then on top of that, we have our third party vendor pieces where we’ve downsized either our utilization of their services, or we’ve negotiated better rates. We do have standard cost of living increases built in to our contracts, so there is a certain amount of somewhat natural pricing increases that will occur across the board and then for those clients that do have orders, they still want to make sure that they are competitive in their bill rate which translates through to the pay raise, but with that said, in the past year we have been experiencing about a 3% increase in our revenue per traveler per day. We are aided a little bit by the market environment certainly, but the team has done a great job and has actually brought our average daily rent cost, just kind of rent cost, down on a year over year basis, so we think there is further opportunity even in some of our direct cost areas, and that will also help us maintain some stable margins."

You will recall that the company recognized the benefit from the settlement of a liability arising from the MHA acquisition that had the effect of reducing unallocated overhead in the third quarter by $1.5 million. The decreased operating margin was primarily due to specialty mix and labor cost within the SG&A that, while lower than the prior year and prior quarter by 24% and 9% respectively, are at levels that properly position us to grow in the future. As we are all aware, the company took significant steps to rightsize the organization and improve the overall operating structure of the company in order to achieve sustained efficiencies. We've made great progress over the years and, in particular last year, to integrate and improve efficiency in our operational support functions. At the same time, healthcare organizations will experience continued pressure to improve productivity without sacrificing the quality of patient care, which will draw additional interest to innovative solutions around the acquisition, retention and management of their workforce. Because clinical labor is such a large component of every healthcare organization, proactive and strategic workforce management will always be a critical factor to their success. And three, to take our relationship with the healthcare community to a higher, more strategic level, by providing them with more innovative solutions to help manage their patient care quality, efficiency and the cost to provide such care. Instead, we have opted to preserve more capacity in our revolver for strategic opportunities. Even with this environment, demand for nurses with specific skills and situations where the facilities have captured all they can of the nurses willing to take a permanent position, but still have openings, in their own way create a market that is constrained by supply. And having stronger leaders, sales representatives and operations allows us to not only execute well, but also to be more agile and make changes and investments that will evolve the business. We are halfway into the project and have already identified a lot of low- hanging fruit and many bigger opportunities that we will be executing throughout the year. This capability is a product of our stronger and more diverse team, who is working in a more unified and collaborative way to reach our goals. Not only will our Core businesses be helpful, but our innovative service offerings, such as Managed Services and RPO, will help hospitals to achieve their efficiency and effectiveness goal. While there is no crystal ball to give us precise answers to future events, we certainly do study past dynamics of our industry and the projected future demographic drivers. The most recent studies suggest that the gap between demand and supply of nurses and physicians will increase twofold by 2016, just due to the aging population alone. On a full year basis, unallocated overhead decreased 36% compared to the prior year, as a result of the steps taken by management in response to the market downturn. As we see the market come back, albeit slowly, our collective desire to fill demand will more likely result in increasing compensation and benefits to travelers to have them take such positions rather than decreasing bill rates to increase the apparent demand. We generated $99 million in cash flows and significantly paid down outstanding debt. This alone will place incremental burdens on the clinical labor supply that cannot be simply absorbed. We believe we have an educated view that guides us in our own long-term strategic planning and the investments we make in our business, and we're happy to share those thoughts with you. We launched our Recruitment Process Outsourcing business about a year ago. The bigger question is, what will the trajectory of demand and supply be over the next five years? As a side note, I think most of the companies in our sector have experienced perhaps their highest margins they have seen, which seems counter to traditional supply and demand theories. Although days filled volume is still relatively small compared to our other specialties, this expanded service will enable us to serve our clients across a broader spectrum of their revenue-generating services. These actions allowed us to preserve the financial health of our balance sheet, to maintain our profitability and industry-leading position, to improve our operating leverage for the future, to build stronger and deeper relationships with our clients and to continue to evolve our brand. Our RPO and Managed Services offerings can help facilities to shorten recruitment cycle times and fill workforce gaps more quickly, minimizing revenue loss and disruption to patient care. Nurse and Allied segment SG&A was lower reflecting the efforts taken to reduce ongoing operational costs and favorable professional liability experience. So during this period of steady and modest growth over the next couple of years, there are three key components that guide us in our strategic plan: First, to continue building stronger client relationships and gain market share without sacrificing price or margins. This was primarily due to lower labor costs. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. We successfully renegotiated our credit facility, providing flexibility and capacity to invest in new opportunities. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio at year end was 1.9x, and this does not take into account that we could very well utilize capacity in our revolver as we did in the past to cover the letters of credit we cash collateralized. We do, however, have more opportunity to gain efficiency within the Locums operations. In the third quarter, we began segregating costs that are not directly associated with the individual business units and reflecting them as unallocated corporate overhead. At some point, however, after our market has seen steady modest improvements, we will likely see a tipping point, where multiple factors have improved enough and the powerful demographic forces take hold and create a significantly-higher need for our services. In late 2009, we launched a very focused and disciplined effort to assess and redesign our processes to be more effectively serving our clients, and to create a more flexible and scalable infrastructure, which will further reduce costs in the future. These efforts will have positive benefits for us in 2010, but even more importantly will provide sustainable cost savings and productivity improvement into the future. However, the aggregate orders are still at relatively low levels. For the full year, we generated $99 million of operating cash flow, which was used primarily to pay down debt. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and other quarterly and periodic reports, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. In addition, since the nation is at full capacity in residency programs and nursing schools, the new supply of clinicians is relatively capped, and will not replace the huge contingent of clinicians that are set to retire during the next five years. Adjusting for this item, unallocated overhead in the fourth quarter was consistent with the third quarter. We streamlined our infrastructure, giving us better leverage going forward if the market rebounds. In these closer relationships, our fill rates are nearly double the rate at multi-provider accounts. Throughout 2009, the sales team did an excellent job of educating clients on the necessity of maintaining rational pricing and competitive wages. For example, our projection today is that the first quarter days filled volume will be roughly flat to the fourth quarter.","So it really is that bill-to-pay spread, and it's just the sheer availability of assignments and the supply wanting to be competitive in going after those assignments. And then you have days filled, which is your resulting volume from all of that. And you might see a little bit of margin degradation over a couple of quarters than then overtime. Are you starting to see some capacity come out of the industry? Now as the number of assignments increase and we're trying to recruit more supply to come into the market, we believe we will have to increase wages along with that. But I would expect that as the market rebounds to a more normal state, you would actually see the percentage come down, because more of your individual facilities would start to pick up in their demand and their orders. Jeffrey Marc Silber BMO Capital Markets U.S. And I'm just curious, in your other two segments, what do you have to see in order to make the same move there? That's not what we're projecting. A nice surprise for us has been the number of assignments that we have been able to fill immediately and not needing to use subcontractors. Can you talk a little bit more color around the specialties that you're filling? They want quality nurses on time, and they want to work with a company That can stand behind what they say they're going to do. Tobey O'Brien Sommer SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division Regarding the Locum Tenens business, I just wanted to get a sense for what the length of your visibility in the business, extent to which customers are placing orders farther or shorter out in the future. With that said, we're always looking for that next recruiter, and hiring maybe one or two people to help fill the pipeline along the way. And so, while there will certainly be continued interest in VMS -- and I think, that's why we're glad that we have such strong offering and are being recognized as the leading provider in that service -- I think it's also important to remember that the greater growth from our industry will come from when orders start to rise all across the country, at all types of facilities. Then you have days available, which are, what's available and needs to be filled this month? Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director I'm sorry, to make the... Jeffrey Marc Silber BMO Capital Markets U.S. To make the same kind of moves, in terms of when will you be comfortable increasing your recruiter headcount and... Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director In nursing, we have a lot of capacity within the recruitment staff that we already have, as we've said over the last couple of quarters, we have downsized our recruitment staff quite a bit with the downsizing of the brands, and just through natural attrition. We don't think it'll be material and significant. So we feel that we have a fair amount of capacity and productivity improvement that we can gain within our existing recruitment staff. And yet, those recruiters themselves are at about half the productivity they were in the first quarter of 2007. Incorporated, Research Division So it basically -- you're starting to see the orders come up and you want to maintain the fill rates. And we felt that we might have capacity within our existing recruiters, but the reality is we were probably stretching them too thin. So it caused us to relook at the number of recruiters that we have on staff, and that are out there trying to drive the new supply. So we've now have contracts with five of the seven subcontractors, and are receiving orders from them and are starting to place more people. And I know it's somewhat stabilizing, but did you have excess capacity there? And it takes a solid six months to get somebody trained and productive in the Perm Placement business. And we feel that, and I think the client would agree, that we've worked through everything quite efficiently and to their satisfaction. As I mentioned though, we are not necessarily seeing orders rise. But just out of the chutes, our recruitment team did a better job than even we expected in getting those positions filled. As the orders have come down within the industry over the least year and a half, those larger VMS and preferred provider clients have become more important and a greater percentage of the overall orders. But you also have a lot of very short-term fill-in-the-gap, over-the-weekend, last-minute type of work. One, to attract supply and to have greater selection for our healthcare professionals. It should be smooth throughout the year, assuming our projections are appropriate. So we saw our fill rates actually go down a little bit towards the end of the year. James J. Janesky Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division And if we kind of take the first quarter revenue outlook and assume a slow but steady recovery, and take the first quarter gross margin outlook and assume a steady recovery, I would be projecting a loss for the first quarter and all of 2010 on a GAAP EPS basis. If you just look at the percentage of business that we have done with this particular account in the past and what we're doing already in the first quarter, relative to others, I think it's meaningful enough, based on where the low order volumes are today."

And then finally, we are continuing to streamline clients and clinical operational functions into our shared services model. Excluding these items, the remaining increase in unallocated overhead was due mainly to having a full quarter of Medfinders corporate costs. This can also include working more efficiently with Home Healthcare Services to provide transitionary care and management that reduces unnecessary and unprofitable readmissions. However, there is pretty consistent agreement that the long-term demand and supply dynamics of the physician staffing business continue to be strong. On an organic same-store basis, the nurse and allied business generated growth of 9% compared to the prior quarter and 17% compared with the prior year. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our S-3 filed on December 21st, 2010, annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2009 and other periodic reports, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. Based on the success we are running ahead of our original projection to add $2 million of additional annualized EBITDA by the fourth quarter of 2011. The marketing team that we do have in place is extremely strong and they were able to achieve high productivity levels. We are now able to partially fill that demand directly through our own newly acquired Nursefinders’ local office network. With our top five states spanning the West, Northeast, the Southeast and the South, our MSP orders have been trending at approximately 20 to 25% of our overall travel nursing demand. Our plan is to use the majority of our cash flows to pay down debt and our goal is to reduce our debt to EBITDA ratio by half within the next two years. The improvement in direct fill rates is one example of the near-term benefits we are experiencing from our MSP offering. As we mentioned earlier, the allied business is undergoing the greatest amount of integration activities and the team there is doing an excellent job working through the transition. Excluding the impact of acquisition, revenue decreased 8% reflecting a 9% decrease in days filled offset by a small increase in our pricing. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $4.8 million. Likewise, the travel nurse orders brought over by the Medfinders MSP contracts are now being primarily filled directly by leveraging AMN’s large pool of travel professionals. Finally, capital expenditures should be between 6 million and 8 million, which is higher than the prior year due in large part to the addition of Medfinders and several projects supporting the integration. Our tax rate should be in the mid 50s with a cash tax rate closer to 20% taking into account the utilization of tax benefits, primarily from the Medfinders acquisition. However, it is equally important that we continue to have solid execution in our core businesses in order to meet or exceed our client’s needs and expectations. Just as an example to this in the top four MSP contracts that were brought in by the Medfinders acquisition, we have already increased our Travelers on Assignment directly filled by AMN by nearly 200. This can come in a variety of forms such as managing their total supplemental staffing in a more streamlined way, reducing their overall labor spend, and improving their cost and quality of new clinician talent. We just need more train marketers in the field meeting with current and potential clients. Unallocated overhead, excluding stock compensation in the fourth quarter was 9.8 million, down from 12.6 million in the preceding quarter and higher than the prior year expense of 5.4 million. Our new home healthcare segment generated [ph] revenue of 14.3 million and operating income of 1.1 million for the quarter. And the overall number of facilities with travel nurse orders continues to move upward both sequentially and year-over-year. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. The second key focus for the team has been to increase the direct fill rates in our existing managed services programs through the sharing of our expanded local and national candidate supply, whereas AMN previously used sub-contractors to fill our local per diem orders. Travel nurse order levels continued to increase throughout 2010 and going into the first quarter both sequentially and year-over-year. Allied staffing revenue is expected to be down sequentially due mainly to the anticipated disruption from the integration activities. Healthcare organizations are beginning to transform their delivery models to address the challenge of providing increased access to health services while maintaining quality and reducing costs. The full year operating cash flow of 8.1 million was net of an 11.5 million of acquisition and financing related cash costs that were not capitalized as part of the transaction. A fourth quarter seasonal decline is typical for this business, but we do believe our new search activity was weaker than it should have been due to having two few marketers to cover sales territories. During his seven years with AMN, Brian oversaw the company’s corporate financial planning, capital funding, business development, and SEC reporting activities. As a part of this, they are gravitating to strong partners who can offer more sophisticated solutions that can deliver value and efficiencies.","But on the travel side one of the main ones is that traditional environment, I mean four or five companies that have an order, but in an MSP environment only one company controls the order. But history would show that as the business grows and you’re presumably getting some pricing up lift, you’re able to increase your wages accordingly and basically maintain the gross margin level. It’s really, it’s about the demand, but it’s more about the supply on the physician side of the business. Second, we also - when we don’t fill a job in a traditional market, we don’t make any money. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director And remember the reason it’s lower is that they have a percentage of unskilled workers and even within their nursing component there maybe more LPNs working. Tobey Sommer SunTrust Robinson Humphrey So the various payroll taxes and the increases you’ve seen not really a material impact so far this year? One is what was the organic growth that we were on track to achieve even without the benefit of the Medfinders MSPs that were brought to the table and we would have had organic growth without that, but on top of that, we had the revenue synergies that came from our ability to directly fill more of the travel demand that Medfinders brought to the table with their - and if I mentioned the four largest ones, where we add in an incremental 200 travelers at those accounts. And you hit an important point because now we have to focus more and more on supply, which we think is good news, because with our large database of candidates that we have already pre-approved and have been talking with over the last several years, we have the largest available network. And our expenses for sourcing candidates are lower, because candidates want to work directly with the MSP. So we have processes setup so that individuals - we have a traveler that’s not working with us, but it’s staying put in the local area can get referred over for local opportunities and vice-versa if there is a local candidate that might be interested in a travel assignment, they can refer those individuals over and we’ve already seen that initiative improving. And efficiencies come from lower selling cost and the cost to complete for every single order. I mean our fill rates have gone up, particularly at MSP, where we have to order longer in our hands before it gets distributed to other vendors in the marketplace. We wouldn’t forecast that as we do our hypothesis and for scenarios three to five years out, we’re projecting more stable margins across the board. Just wanted to actually, you just stated something I want to make sure I had it clear about your expectations for operating cash flow this year. I’m interested in your view of how gross margin sustains itself or not in a substantial recovery of the labor markets. Formalized cross-selling program that both companies had we refined it and made it better, so we’re actually exceeding expectations in terms of the number of placements. MSPs are kind of budgeted, approved orders. So we’re not picking up the pace I think as fast as we are seeing in travel, but we are more optimistic than pessimistic. Gary Taylor Citigroup And on MSP impact on gross margin kind of in a full recovery cycle, is that I mean my thought is that that would be a lower margin business and would have some impact? So for 2011 we would expect our operating cash flow to grow by more than 50% from that adjusted 2010 number. In addition you get the benefits of continuously improving the process within an existing account, so you can begin to maximize payroll processing, collections QA. So, we’re feeling better about the supply of physicians, but we are always shortage. Do you have give up gross margin in return to historic levels if we see competition for nurse labor and demand increase substantially? And we’re really working to come with more efficient ways to get them on assignment as part of our priority. I guess I was just trying to understand and it doesn’t sound like it’s the case, but you have a couple of quarters where your profitability is under a little pressure as you make the transition and then you sort of rebound late this year, early next year or is it sort of more smooth, because it’s more profitable business naturally and it sounds like you are saying more of the latter, you think you will at least do as well if not a little better, it sounds like. As I mentioned, per diem because of the short-term nature of the business you are literally booking day-by-day, shift-by-shift. We don’t have to work on orders that aren’t valid. Obviously on the profit side there are some, our productivity per recruiter with higher fill rates can be substantially higher, because of that also the validity of orders is better. One, I was wondering if you could comment on the supply of folks on the travel side, travel nursing side as well as the physician side. Is it more share gains that you are gaining vis-à-vis others or is there some aspect of the underlying tone of the market whether it’s hospitals being a little more optimistic about volumes or just any color that you can provide on that? And then just the last question on cash flow from ops in the fourth quarter, I think you said 4.8 million. Obviously, it’s hard to predict always with accounts, but we have a very good set of controls in place to mitigate these things and we’re not really seeing any other clients with any issue and is similar to what we have it is one [ph]. If you look into 2011, I’m just not giving complete guidance on that, but I guess if you consider 2010, our operating cash flow for the year was about 8 million, but that included almost 11 million or almost $12 million of costs that were associated with the transaction. But if we assume kind of going out three to five years and we maintain our gross margins at a stable level pretty much across the board you’ll have some puts and takes. It’s about a $0.02 impact to that order. So we certainly have to adjust our compensation and pay rates to adjust for that and maintain a relatively stable margin. And so again I think most providers in the space, we are continuing to do things to become more efficient centralizing functions, things that hadn’t been done before that now we feel we have the infrastructure and the resources to handle. So, our supply has begun to come back. We help them aggregate their spending and in dry battle [ph] some efficiencies for them, but just not all of just about the kind of the bill rates."

We have been able to continue also monetize our thought leadership expertise through projects and surveys that leverage our extensive relationship and database of clinicians. We have also experienced recent improvement in our margins, our fill rates, and our re- book rates. Regarding our policy on forward-looking statements, various remarks and characterizations we make during this call about future expectations, projections, plans, prospects, events, or circumstances constitute forward-looking statements. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $6.5 million. Our more powerful integrated sales team led the industry in MSP growth, winning over 20 new MSP clients in 2011 with an estimated 80 million in annualized growth spend under management. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.04 for the fourth quarter and $0.11 for the full year 2011. As previously mentioned, with the recent sale of our Home Healthcare business, the operating results for this segment have been classified separately as discontinued operations for all periods reported. Fourth quarter revenue from continuing operations was $222.1 million, up 8% from last year and down 3% from last quarter. Although there are certainly some head winds in reimbursement rates for skilled nursing clients, we continue to experience strong demand for therapist overall and we’re focused on growing our therapy supply. Excluding the integration and credit agreement amendment costs, our adjusted full-year effective tax rate from continuing operations was 58%. What we are seeing today is the powerful combination of having a highly engaged and capable team coupled with the strategy that puts our client’s needs and goals at the forefront of everything we do. Based on current full year forecasts, our effective income tax rate should be approximately 50% with a cash tax rate closer to 25% taking into account the utilization of the previously-noted tax benefits. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and other periodic reports, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. We help these clients to gain more control, visibility, and consistency in the utilization of their clinical labor, while also improving quality and compliance. These results exclude our Home Healthcare segment, which were considered discontinued operations. Also the impact from operations changes implemented over the last several years as well as the prior year having unusually high bad debt expense. And his extensive sales leadership, operations, and business development experience make him ideally suited to lead our locum tenens business. The continued growth has been driven by the addition of more MSP clients, increased supply of candidates, improved fill rates, and strong re-book rates. However, due primarily to the continued utilization of certain tax benefits from the Medfinders acquisition, our net cash taxes paid in 2011 was less than $500,000. Over the past few weeks, we have seen an improvement in new orders and with the number of facilities that have orders open. As an example, we are in the process of opening a local office in New York City to serve a very large MSP client that we implemented in the fourth quarter, and to serve other clients in the area. During 2012, we expect this transition to be both operationally more efficient and to ultimately reduce DSO. While volume is up in the fourth quarter, our current open orders are down slightly year-over-year, which we attribute to a weaker flu season and our improved fill rates. Our Locum Tenens segment revenue decreased 10% from the prior quarter reflecting a 7% decrease in day sales and a 3.5% decrease in revenue for day fills. A second factor was the revenue synergies we enjoyed from our combination with Medfinders, which enabled our team to significantly improve fill rates. We also continue to focus on maintaining marketer and recruitment bench strengths to insure we are able to achieve high fill rates on our active searches. During the fourth quarter, approximately 1/3 of our Nurse and Allied revenues were generated by MSP clients. Our government division, which supplies all specialties, also experienced greater softness due to funding delays and budget constraints. The leverage and efficiency inherent in our MSP delivery model has also contributed to our improvement in margins for this business. This prestigious award was based on our high level of strategic partnership and compliance with their quality standards. Of course, none of this is possible without maintaining a very keen focus on the quality of our healthcare professionals that we source and select for our clients.","They help us to move our gross margins and EBITDA margins along And so while they weren’t huge things, such as our RPO business growing, our EMR staffing business continuing to do very well, and then some of the smaller workforce consulting projects that we’ve done and we’ve had a nice one in the fourth quarter help us to incrementally move that needle upwards on, again, growth and EBITDA margins. So as a part of the MSP sale, we can have a very strategic discussion with our clients about what’s going on in the market and what rates will be necessary to meet the demand and the fill rate that you’re looking for. The first thing is quality, fill rates, in one of those 2 orders, and then third tends to be price. It’s also reflective, Frank, of us being able to build up our marketing staff, the individuals who are you in the field actually talking with our clients, potential clients and building those relationships and we’ve seen more successes at some of the larger teaching facilities, so starting to see more pockets of opportunity open up and we have more of the sales staff to actually be out there educating and selling. Regarding the 3% of revenue per day filled, it’s a combination of both true bill rate declines in those areas I just mentioned, particularly radiology, where they’ve felt the hardest impact of reimbursement changes that have been made over the last 5 years, and just continue to feel pricing pressure in that business. But also there was a reduction in the on-call hours and the overtime hours. So I -- as Susan mentioned earlier, we are getting bill rate increases, we also are planning to pass along the majority of that to both drive more supply as well as to offset the housing cost increases. Our ability to fill the placements that we had gotten in the third quarter in particular was kind of a nice kind of little uptick in searches. Some very key ones and large ones did come from other competitors, and even those that didn’t where they were more traditional competitive accounts where there was no previous MSP, we are picking up share there because typically in a non-MSP client our fill rates are about 0.5 of what we would expect when we actually are the MSP provider. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Well, for 2012, the effective tax rate we’re projecting about 50% based on our current full-year forecast and that should be -- it should be the same for all the quarters. We do measure our orders and our traveler count based on those MSP, and what we consider sort of the traditional competitive accounts. They’re hiring fewer Locums in those areas and they are wanting to pay them less, and when they do hire them, they don’t want to pay them overtime, and they don’t want to put them on call."

The travel nurse demand growth was in both traditional and MSP clients and evenly distributed across geographies. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and our other filings with the SEC, which are publicly available. Reported net income from continuing operations was $7.1 million in the fourth quarter and $16.3 million for the full year. We continued our strong momentum in this area as we added over 20 new MSP clients with an estimated $85 million in annualized gross spend under management, which at maturity, should yield over $40 million in direct revenue for AMN. With clinical labor making up half of a hospital’s cost structure, healthcare providers are increasingly seeking sophisticated, innovative solutions to improve patient outcomes, cost management and access to talent. And the third investment is to streamline our technology infrastructure for greater efficiency, scalability and agility. Recently, however, therapy orders have declined as a result of several reimbursement impacts. In nurse MSP contracts, we typically achieve fill rates that are nearly double those in traditional contracts which enables us to grow faster during periods of expansion and provides some protection during downturns. To ensure we are well-positioned to maximize this future opportunity, we are making increased strategic investments today in 3 key areas: The first is what we call our digital transformation, which includes innovative recruitment technologies, job distribution platforms and mobile applications to aggressively attract more candidate supply. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $18.5 million and for the full year was $60.5 million. The New York and Philadelphia offices that we opened in 2012 have continued to produce month-over-month revenue growth as they support MSP accounts. This year, we also made progress in our other workforce solutions, such as recruitment process outsourcing, electronic medical records implementation and workforce consulting. The longer term trends sealing demand for our services include the growing adoption of workforce solutions, the increased demand for healthcare from the aging population and the addition of 30 million insured citizens and the worsening clinical labor shortage as clinicians and physicians retire. Gross margin improved by 350 basis points from the prior year and 110 basis points from the prior quarter from improved recruiter productivity and a favorable reduction to our sales reserve due to improved trending in our sales adjustments. Clients with orders, clients with clinicians on assignment and nurse applicant supply were also up year-over-year. For 2013, our MSP pipeline remains robust and we anticipate further penetration across all of our staffing businesses throughout the year. Despite lower demand and supply constraints in certain markets, the business continued to stabilize, with working nurses, accounts with revenue and bill rates flat sequentially. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, should, would, project, may, variations of such words and other similar expressions. Going into the first quarter, strong bookings have continued within the travel nurse business and we expect volume to be up approximately 20% year-over-year. Regarding our policy on forward-looking statements, various remarks and characterizations we make during this call about future expectations, projections, plans, prospects, events or circumstances constitute forward-looking statements. This improvement in leverage was achieved in spite of the increased spending on our digital sourcing workforce solutions and technology initiatives.","I think we were almost up to 80% and our overall fill rates were good. Most of the work will be done by the summer of 2013 and then we’ll have follow on projects after that. The first was around digital transformation and driving more supply. This actually brings a lot of science into the measurement systems, but if you take a look at our applicant experience which was the catalyst for doing this, we wanted to change the way that people can get a job here and that application process might have taken up to 4 hours in the past. One of the reasons we like the one, of course, is we protect existing business we already have and have a chance to fill even more and then of course the other one is we love it when it’s incremental business. But now we’ve actually got a more diverse pipeline of allied and then the Locum sector has started to pick up in terms of MSPs. They’re going to want the supply and so they’ll increase prices slightly to match that. I’ve talked about this before, but when med surge orders start coming back I feel like the industry could return to its prior high overall and we saw a 225% increase in med surge orders. I think we are already seeing a little bit of a benefit because clients are wanting to really get their arms around their cost structures and find new ways to become more efficient, more agile and that leads to more sophisticated outsourcing solutions. It’s a tough time for our customers, but it’s a good time for those who are putting in place MSP programs if it helps them become more efficient in their use of contingent labor. And so making sure that that is efficient and the tools are in the hands of all of our sales people 24/7. If you just take a look at the last 13 weeks, and we’re early on in this, we only have job distribution, some of the communication tools and some of the improvements in that application experience finished at this point. We’re seeing some positive, early results by being able to get our jobs out to the markets faster and more efficiently. Our demand in travel nursing was up about 5% over the last quarter, but is 100% over the same timeframe last year when our order volume was dropping as you might recall. As a matter of fact, there was just a small improvement even in our Locums business, I didn’t mention that, but there was a slight improvement in fill rates there in the quarter and we think as we get more MSP business in that space that we could see more significant increases in our fill rates there. The projection for the first quarter I said $1.6 million stock comp. I think Ralph described this earlier, and that allows us to weather through those fewer orders better. But it’s not as if there’s a permanent end either because if these initiatives work we’ll be wanting to continue to spend money in areas to drive more supply. Maybe the best way to describe that is to have Bob talk about the MSP pipeline and some of the changes in the trends that we’re seeing there. But on the fill rate side, our fill rates on our MSP customers went as high as they’ve ever been in the quarter. Now we’re able to more seamlessly get jobs out within hours to a much broader set of opportunities and we also have the analytics to determine where we’re actually getting return for those dollars and where we’re getting the most leads, applicants and ultimately placements so that we can more efficiently spend our dollars to attract new supply. But when we do this it’s helpful to understand how we think about it, maybe how you should think about it because I give you an example where we just recently closed some business at one client and then another client has decided to go the MSP route. So I think that has translated into some of the order growth that we’ve seen. Incorporated, Research Division Wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what you are seeing in terms of candidates coming in to travel nursing and specifically what you’re seeing specifically with your fill rates and how you think that's trending? Our travel nurse orders today are more than double what they were a year ago. It will download all your LinkedIn information. It will also download who your friends are and where they live so that we can match up to job assignments that are near where your friends are. So we’ve got the supply and the customers’ demand is good. But in our traditional and our MSP accounts, our fill rates were as good or better than they’ve been in prior quarters. There’s a lot of medium and small clients and I think that speaks to different hospital systems taking a look at all their workforce and trying to make some determination as to how they can balance that workforce and how they can decide how much of it should be internal, how much should be float pool, how much should be contract labor. Obviously there is a lot of flu activity late in the quarter. I think yes, we would see improved or like I said fill rate as good, or better than we’ve had. We’d like to have our fill rates in the 40% range on those third parties as well. If we control the orders, we use less sub-contracting and we fill them with our own people. I talked about job distribution and getting our jobs out to the market, more real-time and prior to some of the technology we’ve recently implemented, it was a fairly manual process and could take days to get some of our jobs out to the market. How do you assess whether that's really being successfully market-leading and giving you market share of supplies? Is that anecdotal or how do you gauge how successful those projects are? We did see a little bit of a slowdown in our fill rates on third parties and just that’s -- when we have an order from another MSP provider or a better neutral provider in that space. Much like we have in the nursing business in the past, I mean, last year at this time the travel nurse business, orders were down and yet we grew because we were able to increase our fill rates at our MSP clients and increase our direct fill. Gary Paul Taylor Citigroup Inc, Research Division I wanted to ask to describe -- I know you’ve talked about this digital transformation in marketing helping to drive supply and I was hoping for a few examples of that, but I just had to put it on mute for a second. And since labor is half of their budget, it’s a big area of opportunity for them and I think that our MSP solution as well as recruitment process outsourcing and some of our consulting services really help to identify those kinds of opportunities for them and we can show clients how we can help them reduce their aggregate cost of labor and yet still maintain flexibility as their needs might go up and down over time. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Well, we sold 20 accounts that represent about $85 million in billings and then we think that represents over $40 million worth of direct fill, meaning the AMN portion of that. There are also system changes we can put into place for greater efficiency. But I would tell you that from a growth standpoint, we’re seeing -- our pipeline is growing pretty quickly. But the issue is it was so high to begin with that we haven’t necessarily felt that full impact and then you put on top of that the fact that we have more MSP contracts in Allied and that has really helped us, I think, better than maybe others in the industry because we’re able to improve our fill rates at those MSP clients. So 100% of that will be incremental for us and a very large portion of that should be direct fill. I think some of it is a little bit aided by an improving housing market as well and you’re seeing that translate into improvement in our Physician Perm Placement business as well where we have some of the highest placement productivity that we’ve seen historically and I think that’s a result of both the team’s great efforts, but also the willingness of more clinicians to actually make those moves. But if anything, I believe that their focus on patient outcomes is resulting in a higher desire utilization of outsourced solutions like MSP which ensures that they have the staff when they need them and being properly staffed is one of the highest correlators to patient outcomes. You could download your résumé from Dropbox. So obviously we revisit that question this year, but at this point we’re not planning to change that. Our imaging, lab and respiratory teams are doing an outstanding job and we’re seeing great growth in new applicants and orders and seeing nice POA growth to offset some of the decline in therapy."

Based on increasing new search activity, we expect first quarter perm placement revenue to be up in the high single-digit year-over-year and also up sequentially. Although orders increased from the third to the fourth quarter, overall demand was still softer year-over-year. With clinical labor representing half of a hospital's cost structure, providers will continue to seek and adopt more outsourced workforce solutions so that they can more efficiently address their labor needs. Overall, Allied orders have somewhat stabilized going into the first quarter and are currently flat with prior year. Healthcare providers have tightened spending for several quarters now, and as a result, many are operating with a very lean workforce today. Throughout 2013, we experienced robust double-digit growth in our other workforce solutions, such as recruitment process outsourcing and EMR staffing. Full year 2013 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.69, which compares to $0.35 in 2012. To ensure that AMN is best positioned as the partner of choice for clients, and to capitalize on the future demand trends, we continue to make investments in 3 key areas: The first is expanding and driving growth through our suite of innovative workforce solutions; the second is our leading-edge recruitment technologies to aggressively attract more candidate supply and to create a better experience; and the third is the streamlining of our systems and infrastructure to create greater efficiency, scalability and agility. Since the beginning of 2014, weekly orders had been consistently trending upward. Overall days available, which is our measure of demand, grew by nearly 10% over the prior year, helping to fuel the growth. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $15.5 million, and for the full year, was $58.6 million. January orders were still below prior year levels but February orders have improved nearly 20% and are now slightly above prior year. ShiftWise's VMS enables clients to efficiently manage their contingent staffing needs on one centralized platform. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, planned, will, should, would, project, may, variations of such words and other similar expressions. A 13.9% increase in days filled was the biggest driver of the year-over-year increase. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and our other filings with the SEC, which are publicly available. The closer relationships and higher fill rates we achieve through MSP contracts enables us to grow faster during periods of market expansion and provide some protection during periods of demand softness. Our MSP revenue mix in Locums is still in the single-digits, but we expect the penetration to continue growing based on our sales pipeline and strong client interest. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to be between 22.5% to 23%, which includes a full quarter of ShiftWise expenses, as well as some strategic investments to drive long-term operating efficiency and expansion of our workforce solutions. In the fourth quarter, we were engaged in 2 large client projects, which favorably offsets the typical seasonal decline of 7% to 9%. We find that when they do approve an order with us, their needs are very urgent. ShiftWise also offers technology that allows clients to manage their in-house resource pools more efficiently and automates credentials management, scheduling and timekeeping. Regarding our policy on forward-looking statements, various remarks and characterizations we make during this call about future expectations, projections, plans, prospects, events or circumstances constitute forward-looking statements. Part of this sequential decline is due to the completion of the 2 client projects that I mentioned, the remainder is due to weaker placements.","They're not just older orders that you've had trouble filling, they really are new urgent needs for the future. In another business unit, they may need a full-blown MSP or they may need RPO but it gives them a common platform that they can use to really get better visibility and control into their overall labor spending. Great, and then, with regards to the tone of the orders and what you're hearing from your clients, we're seeing some, and it's regionalized, but some stories about nursing shortages that are cropping up, are you seeing any evidence of that, and if so, is that impacting your fill rate or would you view that as being a positive if it, in fact, is true. But -- and rightfully so, because those orders are harder to fill because we've only got a few weeks to get them done. In terms of fill rates, our fill rates are very strong. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director The other thing to add, Josh, is that we have already seen some early signs where there could be some clients that are currently vendor-neutral VMS clients that were wanting more services and someone to really take on more of the management of their contingent labor process and move more towards an MSP, and so it makes it a much easier referral and handoff if they're already on the ShiftWise technology and they want to talk with AMN about adding on an MSP. Very few of them are flu-related orders. Generally, clients will post them earlier and we have more time to work on those orders. And we saw that reflected in our orders. In times when orders are down, they're even stronger because of our MSP clients. You can have a couple of huge projects, and then you can have a couple of small to medium-sized projects. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director It is better, it's healthier, for sure, both in terms of the duration, kind of the timing of how many weeks orders have been up very consistently but if you -- and we're talking about nursing specifically, but it's true for all of the divisions that orders have been better, but within nursing, as you dive into those orders, we have not only more aggregate orders, but we have more orders at more facilities and at more units within those facilities. And it's obviously a cost benefit to do that, but it's also we know that there's functionally more capabilities for ShiftWise. Last year, we actually had flu orders in November that we're not the specialties or such that we don't think it's just flu-related, we are seeing some pretty good increases there. And even in some cases, making a more conscious decision to lower their core staff and deliberately use more temporary staff to fill in the gaps when their census increases or they have fluctuations. So in this case though, we feel very positive about the client and the pipeline that we've got, and it's a very healthy pipeline, we've got plenty in the pipeline that are actively seeking to contract with us today. And just a question on the physician perm piece, I know it's a relatively small piece of your business, but there was another publicly held company that talked about some softness in that business, as hospitals were using their own internal sourcing rather than outsourcing it to a recruitment company, are you seeing those trends with any of your clients? And by having more staffing companies and more affiliate vendors utilize it, it will bring greater value and efficiency to the market as a whole. And in fact, we've taken great stride -- or made great strides in creating stronger relationships with the in- house recruiters because they do a great job of fulfilling, in many cases, a large portion of the physician recruitment for their organizations but there are often particular positions that they need help with, and so we can enable them to be even more successful by coming in and helping them with particular searches that are really critical to their organization. Robert E. Livonius Former President of Strategic Workforce Solutions - AMN Healthcare First, on the shortages, I would say that the increase in the orders is a reflection of what Susan said, right, you can only work people over time for so long, burnout kicks in, or you take a look at the cost and you realize just how inefficient that is, so some of the demand is coming from that. So January orders improved weekly, we're on our sixth consecutive week of watching the orders grow. So -- and it's several things that don't make for a perfect environment for those healthcare systems that were planning on new grads to meet all of their future needs. It was interesting, as we were on our third quarter call, we talked about orders rising in October, but then we actually started to see them fall off in November and December. The team has done just an excellent job kind of benchmarking ourselves against the marketplace, specialty by specialty, job order by job order, putting in place yield management tools, and we do expect those margins to hold up. But our fill rates are up a couple hundred basis points year-over-year, kind of across all of our businesses, and that's primarily because of our MSP penetration, our digital sourcing initiative from last year and just great effort by our sales teams. In fact, we've got a couple of clients that started us out with some pilots in 1 or 2 locations just to see if we could make the fills and they've all expanded. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer The cash flow for the year, I would expect it to be -- the operating cash flow to be somewhat similar to 2013. And then, with regards to the orders being up year-over-year in February, were they up year-over- year in October or they were just trending up? And then, if you even look at the makeup of the orders, we're getting far more gross new orders, which is kind of the new orders in a week, so it's not just that we have old orders that we're not filling, as Ralph just said, our fill rates are actually very strong right now. Joshua David Vogel Sidoti & Company, LLC I know it's only been a few months now, but can you talk to the pipeline of new and potential MSP clients? But we're also getting a lot of new orders in. And then, there have been some great opportunities for us to collaborate and perhaps win business, so we might not either one of us have won if we hadn't come together. We did see orders start to trend down in November, but they did bottom out week 52 of '13. So fill rates -- I mean, probably the only market thing we haven't talked about is a little bit of a reluctance to post orders on a timely basis. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer All right, I think, the depreciation would likely move up a little bit as the year progresses, as you see the flow-through of some of the increases in our capital expenditures, so maybe a couple hundred thousand higher quarterly by the end of the year, probably because the opposite on the interest expense you'd see the similar decline as you go through the year. So I'm very excited about the energy in the whole company has, I think, taken a notch up, in both ShiftWise sales team and our sales team, about the enthusiasm around being able to collaborate when we need to and compete on RFPs where we wouldn't otherwise be on. What we do hear from our clients, and I think it shows up in our orders with them, is that they have cut their workforce very thin and they are, in many cases, operating very lean with their core staff. Next question, probably for Brian, you're talking about some spending or as you expand ShiftWise and you have some strategic investments, I was wondering if you could give us some direction on where you see cash flow in 2014? But naturally, as I've had a chance to review the pipelines, I'm very pleased to see that there's not a lot of overlap, frankly, there's a lot of new opportunities in both segments. Other encouraging signs in our other businesses are Allied orders are kind of flat and that's a good sign for us, that business had a rough couple of years because of reimbursement. We did a very good job, I think, of communicating the importance of maintaining the vendor neutrality which was essential to doing the deal with ShiftWise to begin with. So we're filling them very quickly, as soon as the client will agree, at least. We were in the process of upgrading our platform. So the free cash flow, we are increasing our CapEx a small amount from 2013. So there's -- while there are some discouraging things and when you look at the last part of the year, that was a bit discouraging, most of the signs we're seeing today lean towards improvement as we get through the year. We're more than exceeding their fill rates that they had in the past, and in fact, the time to fill at a shorter period of time and at an overall average lower cost per hour. In fact, every single week, we've seen our demand and orders improving. So we're certainly more optimistic, but I think, part of what you saw at the end of the fourth quarter was maybe a reflection of fewer jobs that were open, fewer people quitting because they weren't so certain about where that next job will be. And the other thing about it that, I think, we're very encouraged by is that we were concerned initially about getting enough people to sign up as subcontractors, and we've got plenty in the pipeline now."

The CapEx, as Kathy noted, we've only spent $1 million so far for basically equipment and we've been giving guidance that we will be spending $7 million to $10 million. So it looks like we're gaining strength in the booking department at the present time. It's a very energy-efficient way of improving production. The real world is that it's always varying, your load is, and this digital compressor has a very, very pronounced positive effect upon doing that. Therefore, we pretty much stayed constant with our manpowering. I would like to introduce Kathy Sheffield, our CFO. But, since that point in time, it doesn't look like it's happening in the construction market, at least for us. It will relieve a little tightness we have on a couple production lines. So, our second quarter results on shipment are not going to be limited by orders, they are going to be limited by our ability to get out the door. What it will do for us, however, is as we get the building done, it will improve our ability to run some portions of our building - our production a little more efficiently than we would have without this. So what happened last quarter was that the cost increases for material did come through and the price increases weren't effective. Capital expenditures for the quarter were right at $1 million and those expenditures were related to equipment purchases which would increase our production efficiencies. It doesn't cover the full spectrum of the varying loads that occur due to the varying temperatures and varying internal loads of a building. And the other part of that which also was having problems in the past and seems to be somewhat stronger now is the manufacturing buildings market. Our second quarter actual shipments is pretty well covered with orders which we presently have in the backlog. Our problem is when more in getting the personnel trained and working properly, and in getting more orders for the facility. Then coming into the second quarter now, into April this year, there's been an indication that the order is on the upswing. Norm Asbjornson Yes, we had record-breaking sales performance, primarily due to having come into the year with a larger backlog than we did in 2007. On what we've got in the backlog right now, basically we had a price increase on December 1 of last year and that didn't get worked through our backlog until the very last part of the last month of last quarter. We still have a little opening for new orders and that is rapidly being taken up. It has been very strong bookings and as a matter of fact, weakness in the first quarter in bookings was in the first two months - January and February, and we had a strong March, stronger than it was a year ago. And this has a huge opportunity for a number of reasons, among which is its ability to save energy. And so it's a good measurement of the overall capability of a machine to save energy, but it is a very poor measure of its ability to totally do that. We had a negative order input in that we did not book quite as much as we did in 2007. We believe we have adequate equipment to get ourselves, not only through this year, but through next year with a reasonable amount of growth in it too and what we're setting up in the way of what we're doing on the building portion is not so much what we need this year, it is not, it is for future years. As I spoke earlier, order input looks very good. It will provide us what we need for several years in the future in building capacity, so our capital needs in that area will disappear for some time to come and the machinery side of it, we're quite good in, so the company is sitting in extremely good condition and getting better as far as what capital needs we have in the company for substantial growth. So it has fairly good volume capabilities depending largely upon high-rise office buildings, of course, for the market. Kathy Sheffield Good afternoon. Many of you may be aware of some of our common terminology in our industry called SEERs, in other words Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio or plain EER for larger equipment which is just Energy Efficiency Ratio. Our present backlog and our present pricing of our backlog is certainly adequate to make profit. The price increase will be effective obviously in most everything for this quarter and the question mark is, are material costs going to continue to increase faster than our cost increases are going to improve. So our problem in the second quarter is not going to be orders. But, what I'm seeing on the order desk and what I see in the immediate future would tell me that it's going to be strong at least for awhile. We are in a leadership position of implementing that technology and it we think will be a very pronounced effect upon our ability to compete and also to address the energy issue that we're so involved in, in our industry. That, of course, was a hard price increase to sell through to our U.S. customers and it diminished our order input very severely and we have been working off backlog on that operation and the big catch now is because about 80% of our business has historically come out of the U.S. customers for the Canadian operation, is our ability to get orders to maintain that. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated.","Kathy Sheffield Going forward, it is presently at 35%, that's what we expect it to be going forward. Since you've added so much to your plant and equipment in the last few years, what would be a good maintenance CapEx number to look at going forward? Norm Asbjornson The 410-A is rapidly in process of changing and it's one of those areas which is, from my perspective, not understandable about why anybody would buy the old style refrigerant, because you're buying a piece of equipment which minimally in the worst case condition is going to be have a ten-year life, and in most cases, it is going to have a 20 some year life, a 30 year life. But, Norm, on a regular reoccurring basis, you'd need to replace so much plant and equipment. Now we're more dependent upon new orders. So it's up quite a bit from the last year, because as we mentioned to you or we did in previous quarters, we had quite an influx of orders last year which turned out to be a very detrimental thing to have happened because a large quantity of them are in the United States and we got caught in that exchange rate problem. And then on to the steel, how often are you buying steel and what's your procedure there in keeping inventory of steel? And so, you're selling a product today that is going to have a hard time having refrigerant available for it because it's going to rapidly become dependent upon recycled refrigerant. Norm Asbjornson Because most people, once they give us an order for a job, it's usually a pretty short-term order. We always do have that lag effect, however, of our backlog being priced at one price and end up being built at a new cost. Could you quantify a little bit as to what the loss in Canada was, and also could you quantify your backlog? We had all these orders in house at one price and we ended up, when we collected the money in U.S. dollars and converting it to Canadian dollars, taking a real bash on it. And then if you say, that sounds like it's going to be very high, I could then give you a price which if you took delivery today, and we have evolved and I think it's our own evolution of what we've done, but we've taken the percentage of material that's steel, copper, people, and all those things, and we've written a formula, which is not a very complex formula to take governmental statistics which are available on the Internet for each of those commodities and calculate a price for the thing. Of course, right at this moment in time, there's getting to be quite a bit of expectation for inflation in food and in energy use, particularly at the gas pump. We have heard some people who supply componentry which is refrigerant-type determined, making concerned statements about why the industry isn't moving as fast as they think it should, and they're quite concerned that there's going to be a lot of confusion and a lot of trying to get variances from the government and the whole lot, anything and everything sometime next year about this time, because the chaos that's going to exist where somebody hasn't gotten themselves properly prepared to go 410 is going to be pretty substantial for some of these very large names in our industry, I think. Kathy Sheffield Good afternoon. Kathy Sheffield Yes, Joe, it's going to be more in the 8.5% to 9% in the SG&A is warranty. And so, the manufacturers had to evolve that compressor into the new 410 market and also expand it. And we probably have in rolled up unprocessed steel, we have the capability of carrying probably 800,000 pounds of steel and I'm trying to keep that all filled and beyond that we try and make commitments to our steel suppliers for as far as they would commit to us at a price that we think is worth committing to and we're doing that. And then you have to think about what precipitates various types of sales, and new construction is an easy one for our industry to run at, whether you're in the engineering business, in the contracting business, or whatever segment of it. Norm Asbjornson Well, my procedure right now is over inventory, because of the price - constant price upswing we've got, and I have various places within the company here where we can store steel. And then the second question is, if I came to you and said I'm looking for a piece of your equipment, I need you to bid on it and I'm looking for delivery in January of next year or something like that, given the volatility in the commodity prices, how would you quote me? And the second one being that in times of volatility of commodity prices, it's really hard and very risky to go making long-term commitments, which is what you do with national accounts. One, our ability to increase the volume by how many people we can hire and how much overtime we choose to work. Norm Asbjornson We bought it every time, every day that we get a good chance, because we're going to use 30-some million pounds, and at that volume, we are getting many truckloads. Some of it is stored in the flat, in the (inaudible) machines we have what we call warehouses that we store steel in preparatory to using it. Going out and talking to someone who kind of knows they need to replace their equipment and if somebody is in there doing a good selling job on them, it's more likely to result in an order, and therefore the replacement market seems to get healthier when the other market gets a little sicker. And we have in that area somewhere in the 600,000 pounds of capabilities, all of those things being filled, and we try and maintain a full situation on that. Joe Mondello Sidoti & Co. How much of the 2% to 3% decline from last quarter would you say is due to increased raw material prices in this first quarter? And those two elements, of course, make up a lot of what we buy to fabricate with and they make up a lot of the material that our vendors' componentry use. And the reason we're moving forward with it right now is twofold: We were first of all going to move forward with what plan A and then our tenant, who has been renting from us, told us that they were shutting down a plant here and wouldn't need our place for distribution center, so we were going to get back the building that we have rented out and that changed our approach to the whole thing and made it such that when we analyzed how to do all this with that in mind, we decided to go forward and basically set this thing up for a portion of the building anyways and be set up to go to what we think the ultimate capacity in today's dollars would be of approximately $900 million to $1 billion out of this facility in Tulsa. What sizes are those available in and how soon are you going to integrate them into your equipment? Kathy Sheffield You're welcome. You make long-term financial commitments and if commodities are volatile, you are really rolling the dice a lot more risky than you are on the short term order by order basis. The ability for us to keep that there is going to depend upon our ability to guess where this price increase of commodities and things is going, as well as our ability to pass on the price increase to the users. If I look at the order desk and what I'm being told, I'm happy as can be. A truckload is somewhere between the high 30,000 to 50,000 pounds, and we have several of them come in every day. It is not for the cost we incurred because we're tied more strongly to the commodity industry index - steel, copper and iron or aluminum which has been going up faster. Kathy Sheffield Yes. Norm Asbjornson Total backlog for the company is right at $50 million. That had to do with an R&D tax credit and a domestic production activities tax credit and some apportionment factors in various states based upon our new FIN 48 requirement. Norm Asbjornson Well, the manufacturer of those compressors introduced them to the U.S. market in the mid-1990s and nobody accepted them because they were a little more expensive, and the manufacturer happens to be a worldwide manufacturer and found a ready market for it in the Asian market, put it into production over in their Asian plant and sold it into that market, and when we in the early 2000s were looking for ways to address energy as well as some other problems that needed a variable volume compressor, remembered our foolish statement that we in fact didn't want it back in the mid-90s, and we called them up and said, are you still wanting to sell in the United States? Norm Asbjornson So, one way is a speculation on our part and the other one is a speculation on your part, and you just take whatever the governmental statistics say each of those commodities have gone up, put it in the formula, crank out the percentage increase to give us and give it to us. What we are embarked upon right now in the building program is we've spent the past two years trying to analyze how we should build this building out and what effect it would have on our abilities and various things - and by our abilities, I'm saying our efficiencies - what effect it would have on our efficiencies, so we know how it would affect our P&L statement and everything. So it's kind of nonsensical, but there are still a lot of people buying the old equipment, but it's dawning on a lot of them how foolish that is and we're happy to have that happen because, as you know, we've been using - had all of our equipment available at R-410 for several years now. We've gone through the backlog. And if you project that number on, depending upon which of the projections you wish to believe in, in another 20 years, you may be looking at instead of 300 million, you may be in the 500 million area, or certainly in the 400 million and realize that that's going to - if we've got that many million buildings today, we are going to have lot of millions of buildings to handle that population and that's probably the biggest driver. Jon Braatz Kansas City Capital What percentage of your backlog or your orders that come in, how would you say that what percent is quoted the first way versus the latter way?"

It could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. That includes all of our rooftop products from 30 tons all the way down to 2 tons, although the 5 tons to 2 tons aren't in production yet. The one thing that we have added to that is there's more to it than just the production of the heating or the production of the cooling. In other words, we were accelerating our order input a little bit, and therefore some of the orders came in too late to be shipped in the first quarter, and therefore ended up in our backlog. We're taking orders on those products now. And the indication of that is our backlog. So those products have changed the character of our marketing approach and our ability to get orders. Although in addition to changing the product, we must say that we've upped the efficiency of producing heating and cooling, and we now have cooling that runs all the way up to SEER [Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio] of 19 on our smallest unit. And in much of the United States, a fan horsepower sometimes can consume as much energy as the heating and cooling does because it runs pretty much continuously in much of the units and the other items are over intermittent. However, the 35,007 at the end of last year shows that we've increased our backlog by a little less than $6 million, which is a fairly significant amount. I have with me Kathy Sheffield, our Vice President and CFO. Energy is extremely important thing in our economy and in the heating, air conditioning equipment sales, and energy is usually measured on the ability to convert energy into cooling or energy into heating. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. We have addressed that, and we are now marketing our entire rooftop product line with two walls of metal filled by two inches of foam, which is on an insulating value, about twice the insulating value of fiberglass. We're down about 20% from the previous year in our bookings for that period. We continue to this first quarter of 2010 to be affected by the current economic environment which we are in, and that has resulted in negatively impacting the commercial construction market. And there are various categories that allow the reward of the owners buying high-efficiency equipment by some of the utilities giving rebates for the purchase of high-efficiency equipment. The second thing that will happen is we are getting out of the old two- to five-ton product business and going into the new two- to five-ton product, which is an immense improvement, but it also will have an adverse effect on our productivity a little bit. These expenditures primarily related to the expansion and remodel of our Tulsa manufacturing facility. Of course, both those things will be in place starting into the third quarter and will be contributing even better to us than what we're capable of doing today as far as improving productivity. And the whole industry is working hard on that and doing a very fine job, I think, of improving the production of heating and production of cooling. Our backlog in 2009 this time at the end of March was $43,900. And while we won't lose any production days in that move, we will slow the productivity down and hurt us a little bit on our productivity. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy Sheffield. And the blower is a more efficient blower type and well recognized as such by our industry as single-bladed airfoil as opposed to a forward curve, which diminishes the amount of horsepower necessary to move air. The gross margin percentages remain consistent as I they had despite the lower sales primarily to our continuing efforts to improve labor and production efficiencies and also reduction in manufacturing-regulated expenses. We did have a fairly severe winter in parts of the United States this year, and some of that backlog, under a more normal winter would have shipped, did not ship in the first quarter. So we've got a lot of things going for us in this energy environment, and that is primarily the story of AAON at this present time with one other important thing, we are moving our products over into the West side facility here in Tulsa from the East side. The other thing I look at is the nonresidential construction put in place on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, and I look at previous trend lines within that going all the way back into the 1990s, and I find it fairly consistently, January will be the weakest month of the quarter, the first quarter. So the trend line on our bookings performance during the quarter was counter to what the business was actually doing and the way of what nonresidential construction was doing. So those two things are recognized by our customers as being important as well as the cost of producing the energy, whether heating or cooling. So the fan horsepower becomes a bigger factor. And the backlog at the end of 2009, December 31, was $35,756,000 and it trended up to $41,398,000 on the 31 of this year.","So if we were to extend that, I'd get much more optimistic, but I've had a lot of disappointments in the past year and so I'm a little hesitant to tell you it's going to stay with us. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Yet it's really hard to say because we have here, just recently, had a blip of very good order input. We are definitely getting a better position in replacement market than we are in new construction. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO We've had a lot of the things that we bought, machinery and things of that nature, to improve the efficiency of fabricating sheet metal and fabricating things, the value-added part of our business. I would say materially less but not hugely less. We are of the opinion that, that is going to be a very fundamental shift in building construction, primarily due to back in 2008, when that first rescue package was put out, it had incorporated within it a tax credit for people building geothermal homes and also geothermal commercial buildings. We've got a more mature production department and engineering Department, virtually the whole company. I don't see too big ripples in that other than what I spoke of about the productivity that we'll suffer a little bit in. Whereas if you look at the amount of business put in place by the nonresidential construction put in place, it didn't go down quite that much. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Yes. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO There is some going on, no question about that, and the backing off on prices in components that was prevalent, say, a year ago seems to have pretty well ceased. Plus, everything in our society, whether it's the federal government, the states or whatever, are pushing heavy on the energy issue. So I think there is a trend more toward replacement growing better than the new construction. And geothermal, with the exception of having a first-cost penalty, is a very efficient system, and so we think that it's going to grow much faster than the rest of our business level. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC All the weakness is obviously coming from the nonresidential construction. So it's an increase basically in our productivity due to experience as well as the redesign of the products has been very heavily impacted by our knowledge of how to build something more efficiently. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC I was wondering if you could repeat the backlog numbers? We definitely are seeing improvement in this quarter as we go further into the quarter on orders coming in the door. It added an additional dimension to your thought process and probably influenced a lot of people going that way."

We've had a considerable amount of discussion and study going on for a number of years on how to improve our productivity, and we're embarking, and did last year, last quarter in some of them and we're continuing on that. That won't immediately result in change in our bottom line, however, because we have considerable backlog with previous price product in it. We turned it in because we basically warranted out and the newer equipment that we're getting in is a faster and more efficient than the equipment, which we are obsoleting. Now the gross profit was a percentage of decrease due to a number of factors, including increased labor costs and labor inefficiencies associated with the severe snowstorm damage that we had at our Tulsa production facility in February which resulted in 8 1/2 half days of lost production, which also affected 3 production lines. So we worked the deal out with a casino out there, rented their parking lot, put up a very large circus tent, brought 6 truck loads of the equipment somewhere around $1.5 million worth out and held an all-day open house by invitation only to select personnel throughout the United States and some international. This trade show was noticeably, made a noticeable difference based upon the trend line of our sales since the trade show prior compared to this trend line of our, I shouldn't say sales, I should say order entry. Now we also mentioned that the profit was diminished by the fact that we had variances from commodities and purchase parts. Good morning -- or good afternoon, I'd like to introduce Kathy Sheffield, our CFO, and she will go through some of the information with you. And a lot of this is all predicated upon what we spoke of a little bit before here by improve efficiencies. Commercial and retail, down 6.5%; office buildings, down 13.7%; medical and health, down 3.2%; education, down 9.2%; manufacturing, down 28%; lodging, down 31%; municipalities, down 2.3%. Also, that had an effect on the way we ran and for instance, the indirect labor that we had to expand was due to the damage that we had and the problems we had that it took another pretty good chunk of our money. We had capital expenditures of $10.3 million and that was related to the some additional machinery equipment purchases and a new building addition that we started here in Tulsa. We now have the ability to overrun our order input. We've made one change in one production line this quarter, this past quarter. The forward look, however, is of course that those orders are going to go out this summer. People we consider to be very influential in determining what products get purchased in our industry, for the most part consulting engineers. We have been embarking upon considerable building of our facilities and our manufacturing capabilities in order to take care of what we believe to be an upward trend and in our sales. Our backlog at 3/31 of $48 million, was significantly greater than our backlog a year ago. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good afternoon, welcome to our first quarter conference call. So we are in that part of the industry cycle now, whereby we're more or less stable and it looks like maybe we got a slight increase occurring. Our inventory has increased due to increased volume, increased backlog but primarily due to pre-buying of material to avoid raw material and component part increases. The decrease is also attributable to escalating raw material cost that we were unable to pass on to our customers in the first quarter, and an increase in manufacturing supplies related to the increased sales. We are having one difficulty, however, in that, because we now have gotten more capability in our ability to build equipment. And all of these things will improve our productivity. And we've got an additional thing which is occurring in here that's causing us cost which is we are moving production lines around and making them more efficient. And so, we're not able to ship as fast as we want simply because the customers at this point in time are not ready for delivery of the equipment. We will have another one or two changes of production lines going on in the quarter we're in now. We are exchanging some of our earlier computerized sheet metal equipment. The trend line of the order entry prior of the trade show. And so, that's indicative of the upswing in the orders of which I spoke, and which was represented by our 22% increase so far this year. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated.","But once we did that, we have enough capacity to, without those that got damage even running so that we're not hurting. Obviously, the backlog all slipped back on production by somewhere approximately 2 weeks backwards. I sure hope it does more than raw commodities. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Very definitely, and we're putting a lot of effort in and it's the fastest-growing single segment of type of system that we have in our inventory right now. But we've rapidly, we're able to pick that up because of our capacity that we have here. And how big of a driver is replacement right now and where is new construction right now? The biggest problem we really have is in purchase part, finish material like motors and compressors and things like that, because just like our sales, those things contain copper, steel and aluminum, and they are running a little behind where they would like to be on their pricing. Understanding it's going to help you on the efficiency side quite a bit because I've been down there and saw the older sheet-metal machines. And then just the last question, in terms of the shipment that you've lost because of those 8 or 9 days, do you feel like you expedited them by the end of the quarter? And possibly go on up depending upon the economy and what we choose to do about trying to get market share because some of these new products, once we expose the customers to them and so occasionally, we'll hurt ourselves a little on margin in order to get an entryway with the customers so they can see the product and get some experience with it. What we had to do is rearrange some of our equipment so that we could take care of ourselves. DeForest Hinman Paradigm Capital Management Did you actually have any damage to inventories or machinery that are impacting production? But is there anything that they're going to bring to the table that your sales force can go out there and talk to as far as manufacturing in a different way or a quicker way or a better way that gives you guys an edge versus maybe some of your competitors that may still be with some older equipment. It allows us to operate our company very efficiently, but that's not to say some other people don't operate just as quick in putting out a product. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Well, the numbers I spoke, of course, were all related to new construction. And then in terms of, I might have missed it, but in terms of raw material prices, I know you mentioned this in the release, how significant is that? And that drastically overloaded the building and the parts of the building that fell in, the biggest part, the 2 that fell in, all the way down on the floor, were basically a building that looked like it would stand up to anything. I think the new construction is about to take and move up. And then seeing raw material prices... Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO No. I was wondering if you can talk about replacement versus new construction. In other words, if we had not had commodity cost increases, parts cost increase, we wouldn't have $0.03 more on our bottom line. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC And in terms of the snowstorm, did you have to stop taking orders at any point in time just because you felt like you can't get the orders out on time because you had to close the factory for over a week. Shaun Nicholson Kennedy Capital Just on the new equipment that you guys are spending quite a bit of CapEx on. And we're not putting as much effort into those things because we had enough surplus capacity in both of those areas, so that we haven't had to kill ourselves. I think we're now up somewhere in the mid-55% area on replacement versus new construction, where historically we had that turned around, we were usually 55% on new construction, 45% on replacement so it has reversed itself, on that."

And if you back it off 3 months, that's the most optimistic. So we know where the orders are. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good afternoon. That which did not, of course, has to be produced in order to get us into some of the better priced products. And the most notable one in the improvement area, which portends well, is manufacturing was up 42.5%. However, there's a bad side to that because with this $58 million backlog we had at the end of March before the price increases that weren't already built into that a little bit earlier, in other words, some of that market -- some of that $58 million have some price increase in it, some of it did not. Now one of the things, which we've been doing for the past several years has been building buildings, buying machinery and redesigning equipment. And it did not slow orders down appreciably. We build to order and, therefore, we have to build the product. They are obviously pleased with what we're doing as is evidenced by our upswing in orders. So it didn't look really too promising coming off of last year relative to the backlog. Therefore, we will be accelerating our sales throughout this quarter and the second quarter will just definitely be an upswing over the first quarter because we already have all the backlog and all the dollars we're going to shipped are already in the backlog. And therefore, the first part of last year was very good bookings year -- year the last half was a very poor one, which bring that up kind of set the stage for what has happened in the first quarter of this year. If I look at the new construction and going into Architectural Billings Index, I find that they've upgraded their graphics and made it much easier to discern what has been taking place. Net result of all that was that, of course, in January because we came into it with a low backlog, it does take time to ramp up your manufacturing and have the people and everything going. The vast bulk of our dollars are coming all from equipment that has been recently redesigned and the smaller part, which is on the products, which haven't been recently redesigned are in the process of being redesigned now. Consequently, we're pretty optimistic much more so as I said in my news release that -- about the middle of the news release, I said that the new products, improved manufacturing equipment and facilities would give us more advantageous, as well as the improvement we have gotten from training and in some cases, replacing our sales outlets and trying to improve our responsiveness to our customers in our communications and in all other areas. The replacement market last year was distorted toward the first part of the year on orders entered due to the 100% write-off that was given to certain capital and the product such as the heating air conditioning equipment by the federal government. So the only other thing to which we can attribute that is the improved relationship that we have created with our customers, both through the new products, which we brought out that had been well-received, as well as all the other things, which make up a relationship between a supplier and the customer. They're coming in not at the same rapid rate that they have at various times during the past few months, but consistently been good booking months. January turned out to be a very, very good booking month even though it started out very slow for 10 days. However, once the orders started flowing well in January, we started increasing prices. We namely came into this first quarter of this year with a pretty low backlog due to the fact that we had shipped everything to the people who were buying it because they wanted it badly last year to get into the tax break for many of them. So I would say that we're optimistic about the balance of the year. We had a working capital balance of $48.1 million, current asset ratio was 2:1, our capital expenditures were approximately $3 million related to new equipment and the continuation of a building addition. And we're building up a nice reserve of orders for the third quarter and it has a promising look at this point as well. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control, that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. We've looked at what happened in the 2 areas I've mentioned, the one which is the replacement market which did not do very much the last half of last year because they had to have a product in and installed in order to qualify for the 100% depreciation. But also, we don't have the capability to instantaneously turn it around and ship it because we do not have it built in stock. We also are sitting at this point, as I mentioned, with a $58.7 million backlog at the end of March. So January was kind of a slow shipment month. And consequently, we're going to give you pretty optimistic view of what's going on in that arena. However, this year has a 50% depreciation and we believe that there was some people who could not move fast enough to get the equipment ordered and produced and shipped and installed last year since the bill was not passed until December 17, 2010. And now, I'd like to introduce our Vice President of finance, Kathy Sheffield, who will go over some of the statistics with us. We'd like to talk a little bit about the -- basically, the differences in the 2 major places where we got our orders, namely new construction and the second one being replacement market. The increase in gross profit is attributable to the improved productivity from our new sheet metal fabrication equipment that we put into service at the end of last year and our revamp production lines. It shows what the bookings or the actual dollars spent by month are, our year-to-date compared to a year ago. So as we came through the quarter, we came out of it with a very nice backlog right up among the best backlogs we've ever had at any time in the year. And they were not giving us a lot of the orders. So in order to see what's happening today, you drop back somewhere between 9 and 12 months and you can see in the Architectural Billings Index whether it was a growth market as for as how much work the architecture are doing or whether it was declining market.","And the other thing was an engineering, a minor engineering error that we didn't want to leave out there. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer That's correct. We're optimistic that we will bring you even better news. And by doing that and then by refilling the east side backup, what we have done is we didn't just replace the machinery that we got rid off, we actually increased our capacities rather significantly. First off, do you have the backlog at the and of 2011? But the bigger ones have led our price, our order input and the small ones have come along very well, but I would still say that it's been in the larger tonnages where we've done the best. And since the component part of the material cost is just a portion of the material cost, not includes the commodity part, it's the net result and that's probably down somewhere around 3%. One of them was a manufacturing design -- manufacturing problem, a quality issue, if you will. How far along are you and maybe, say, reaping the entire benefits of that -- the improved productivity, you mentioned that you're seeing some of it, but will we see additional gains throughout the year from this new equipment? Having said that, and the fact that you continue to seem to receive solid orders continued through April, which is essentially would be the entire second quarter. Kathy, I see, that your tax rate went up as you weren't able to take advantage of some tax credits and also you didn't qualify for the production activity tax credit. And as far as what's going on in the commodity business, that's a non-issue. So those are the buildings that we furnish equipment to and that's what they are. The backlog at the end of 2011 was $43,993,763. And the other thing is I don't want to just take a bubble and squash it real quickly, if it isn't going to be followed on by additional orders. And that's roughly, you should realize all of that backlog within the quarter. Some of it is going to drift into the third quarter before it gets out of the backlog. If we don't pay a very big penalty for it in May, then we're just going to be talking more optimistically than I am right now. However, we have a newspaper and it's called the Air Conditioning News, and I would just reading in the most recent April issue that in the third quarter, in the nonresidential construction by the association of the contractors that their business was down 3.24%. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Well, if I to believe the Census Bureau here, the strongest demand of all is in manufacturing. In other words, I don't see that as being an issue to be discussed on commodities. And the other thing is that we have replenished some of our warranty throughout the things we had in warranty and everything. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Yes, it is, Jon. And maybe do that in the context of what you're also seeing in terms of some -- maybe component cost increases or steel cost increases whatever. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC Okay, and then in terms of the orders and what you saw throughout the quarter, so February, I believe, you said -- second half of January, February were extremely strong and I believe you said on the last call that things settled a little bit from such a strong February and March. Or how did the order trend look throughout the quarter and into April? And so we give them 30 days from the time we announced the price increase until it becomes effective that they can't order anything anymore. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO No, what happened last year, the first 7 months of last year, we were up 19% on orders. So we did that throughout the last half of last year and into the first 10 days of this year before orders started flowing the way they did. There is price increases coming through from component manufacturers. And along with it's own work we've done and all the money we spent on new machinery and rearranging the factory is paying off and improved productivity, both in our sheet metal fabrication, as well as our assembly areas. And that's not to say I don't think that additional orders are coming. So we had a fantastic April and bookings due to the price increases and so far, it doesn't look like we're going to pay too big at penalty for it in May. The manufacturing, this is on a March-to-March basis, 42.5% up. There are some potential problems on the brand new product as manufacturing gives everything under way. So we have a problem of how do you do that and not affect your production last year? So we are at the present time realizing virtually all the benefits of the new product, of the new machinery on the production we're doing. So it gives them time to cover the orders that they've made bids on to their contractors or to the customers so that they can go on and claim those up because they bid it based upon the premise of our old pricing. When it's all into the system and recognized it with the backlog, we have right now, it's not all going to come out in the second quarter. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC Okay, and then I guess just looking at the backlog, so the backlog was up 20% year-over-year. And thank you for staying with us and being our stockholders and being part of our operation. Whenever you do that, you bring in some orders prematurely because people don't want to pay that extra money. Well, they gave us a lot of orders in April and then what you normally expect is that there's a little bit of a drought that will follow that."

But that particular market has not been flourishing very much in new construction, and therefore, most of what we're getting in that market has been in the replacement area. Now we have projected that they would be in the $8 million to $10 million for the year. The geothermal market typically is dominated by a very standardized product, typically in the 2 tons through to 5 tons in capacity size. But we feel very comfortable with all the new products we have, with the new salespeople we put on; with these new salespeople that many, many of our salespeople have employed over the past few months; and the changes which we've made in the company; and in addition to, of course, the good backlog we have and the good profitability we have. The market is also broken down between replacement and new construction. The manner in which we attack the geothermal market is through condensing units for air handling units, larger package units set up to do variable air volume and rooftop units in all of their configurations. Our backlog did have a substantial upswing. Incoming order rate has continued to be strong and the gross profit went up from 2012 at 20.8% up to 22.9% in 2013. But in our case, we used to be more heavily into the new construction than replacement market. It might be noted here that in the market as a whole, replacement market probably has been dominant over new construction for a few years. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. At March 31, our backlog was $71,731,292 compared to $58,695,211 a year ago.","But just wondering how you say that with the backlog up 20% year-over-year. And then, in terms of the backlog, could you address or do have an idea of whether that's -- whether any sort of new construction has come in there? And I'm just not having a big projection about how much. So for the 2011, the small tonnage equipment was about $15.7 million, $15.7 million. Historically, the best market, the best order times of our year is right now. So I'm just wondering sort of what gives you sort of the caution considering that backlog. And then, it starts deteriorating, going both directions from there on the order input. May is historically our best order month, followed by April and followed by June. But in terms of that new business in that you should be shipping in May, June months, is any of that related to new construction? So we will be feeding off from some of that backlog as we go through the year. It seem like the backlog is pretty strong."

We’re doing a lot of things which are quite new to the industry and quit effective on improving efficiency. Our productivity has been enhanced considerably over the past year somewhat by the new equipment and others just by learning how to help people better and people learning what they’re doing more than they did before. Anyhow when it’s competed it’ll further improve our productivity and obviously give us more future capacity that even we have at the present time. In order to do that $30 million in June, we did not have to run a lot of overtime and we did basically without a lot more people than we’ve been doing say a year ago due to the improved productivity of the company. Capital expenditures for the six months were $1.4 million of the expenses related to new equipment and also office renovation in the Tulsa location. It does seem to be stabilized at about this much and it does seem that we’re getting orders at about this levels, so the longer that occurs the more likely it is that we are going to be able to get the thing of making money, but that’s not for certain. Kathy Sheffield Good Afternoon and welcome to our second quarter conference call. The net result is that we’re down to producing approximately one third of what we were seeing a little over a year ago and we’ve diminished the size of the operation accordingly. We have some test jobs out that look like they’ve improved our energy efficiency and some new technology by somewhere up to may be 20%. The negative being of course it’s a massive change in engineering on every product we use as refrigerant not because we haven’t done the engineering, we have but it’s just the conversion from largely using one kind of refrigerant to largely using the other and the change in some of the componentry that had to change to make that happen. The energy issue has become more and more important and we have done a lot of things to address energy in a positive fashion and it’s helped our sales effort. And as we spoke the last time we have raised the price considerably for all business we did in the United States due to the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar changing very substantially in the latter part of last year and that of course raised our price to our U.S. customers by a considerable margin and in addition to that we raised it enough so that we should have a change to make some money up there which we weren’t making and the net result is a great drop off of U.S. orders which was the majority of our business. So our capacity is as we’ve been speaking for a long time in improving and with all the new product we’re hoping that we will be able to utilize more fully all that capacity. Again thank you and I will turn it over to Kathy Sheffield our Vice President and in charge of finance. Our backlog at this point in time, at the end of June was $67,110,000 which is about $10 million less that it was a year ago. To give you a feel of how much that has changed; during the month of June we shipped a little bit over $30 millions which annualized of course will be $360 million plus and if we had pushed it a little bit, we could have probably made it annualized at $400 million. On the big issues is on the energy issue. The competition is very strong at this point in time, but also the new things which we’ve been introducing have been into our new larger tonnage equipment and they are defiantly technologically advanced products more so than the industry is and so it’s been a more appealing part of our product line. The primary reason for being about $10 million less that a year ago is the fact that as I spoke earlier, the market has not been real strong, but the more defined answer to why we are sitting where we are is the fact that our capability of building product has improved considerably from a year ago and so we’ve been able to ship our product more when the customer wants it and therefore diminish our back log by shipping more when the customer wants it. We probably didn’t increase our prices as fast as what our material costs were because they have been coming pretty strong and they are continuing; in fact they appear to be moving up, accelerated at this point in time. The increase in the net income resulted from our higher sales volumes and improved productivity. A reasonable amount of that increased sales of course was due to the price increases that we put out, but the other part of it probably was primarily due to the productivity increase. With me is Kathy Sheffield, but before we embark upon this I’d like to read the forward-looking disclaimer to you. The increase in the gross profit was a result of higher sales, our price increases and also production in labor efficiencies. If look at our business segments, retail is pretty soft, office buildings are not too bad, medical heath care is pretty good, education is quite strong, manufacturing is probably so-so and other is going along pretty well. We have been notified of price increases on significant components that we buy of up to 15% to occur yet this year. We are at this point in time moving that technology down and we are in the present process as we speak of going into about another 20% of our business with some of these more technology, which will mean that once we get there which will happen by October we would have gone from somewhere around 40% of our market being with basically foam construction and direct drive blowers is the main two things which effect both our roof tops and our air handlers. The third size is presently being introduced into the market place, which when it’s into the market place we’ll be shipping in October. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated.","We would normally get a big surge of orders in the second quarter and somewhat into the third quarter and we would fall behind a little bit and our backlog would build and we would be extending our lead time out. Joe Mondello Sidoti & Company Okay, great and your sales growth sequentially slow down quite a bit quarter-to-quarter, was the labor shortage anything to do with this and if so how much did that have to do with it or was it just mostly market related? Kathy Sheffield Yes, thank you for attending the call today and we’ll speak to you again in November when we have our third quarter results. Shaun Nicholson Kennedy Capital Just one question, I was talking to few people in the retail industry about Wal-Mart and you mentioned energy as your focus and according to them Wal-Mart is extremely serious about that almost versus the cost of putting potential units on their buildings, they want more energy efficient units. We were running done in the two point some percent unemployment, earlier this year and it has gradually moved up into the veracity of 4% or maybe slightly over 4% and as it moved up we’ve been able to slowly get some good quality people to work for us, but what we did due to position we were in earlier in the year. We are making some very significant scribes particularly in the energy area and while that’s on everybody play, we believe we are out running the competition in that area at this point in times. So, in that area, as I say we are very advanced in knowing what to do with energy. Net result to answer your question, the CapEx won't be anymore than it was this year, even on the optimistic side and it could be less by quite a bit. Norman Asbjornson We just put through a cost increase, the last one was affective the first part of June, and if it looks like this we are going to have to have another one maintained at about the next 60 days, we are debating about the magnitude of it right now, we are collecting our data as to how much we are going to have to have and. We did loose their day-to-day business for the most part and yet on the six prototype stores which have been built for their very, very concerned energy as you say, we build them all. The biggest unknowing in this whole thing has to do back with the material side of it. If it gets up, below three quarters of a million start four million, and we hold the price relative to our material and labor cost on the factory and where it is now. Given your strong balance sheet, you guys are as far as innovation probably a ahead of most of most of the competition and given your small-size it seems like you might be a logical acquisition target for the larger player, is there been any activity on that front and what’s kind of your interest level in having those types of discussions? Obviously the overhead states becoming more and more significantly, we’ve gotten the price up to where, if we can get a little bit more volume will make money. When we do that later this year we can’t built it however, but not in a really good environment to build, not in a real high productivity methodology because it want be on a line that’s it’s designed to be built on. Kathy Sheffield Hi. Because as I said we have been notified of a component cost not steel or not copper nor aluminum but some of the components we use are some fairly significant increases about to fall on us right now and they have been all year but they are not being any less now, that are being a greater percentages. Norman Asbjornson Volume, of course, tells us how much money we have to put in reserve for bad debts and reserve for well warranty and all of the other issues that we have to be concerned with and it doesn’t necessarily reflect that we’ve had the problems, because the problems are the anticipated problems that we put it in, but that surge of orders we’ve had, that we’ve produced basically in June drove it up. Frank Magdlen The Robins Group And Kathy, the shares repurchased in the quarter and (b) while Kathy is looking at that, Norm, I took your comment on the backlog, do you mean that the lead time to shift something and bigger, bigger products now is less than it used to be so we should expect you to work with a, say a little small backlog going forward? Norman Asbjornson Well, from an equipment standpoint, it’s going to be modest just like it’s been very modest this year and as I said we have the equipment now we are on a run rate, we could manufacture $400 million a year, with what we’ve got at the present time. We’ve been able to manage that reasonably well with our price increases this past year to where we may have lied a little bit and we may have napped and picked it up with our labor improvements is the way it kind of looks, but it’s definitely still with us and we’re still going to have to be going forward with fairly significant, fairly regular, price increases as we have, and maybe even increasing the size of the them or may be increasing the frequency of them. In the past what is happen, because there is a little cyclic-ness in our marketplace. Kathy Sheffield Hi, Joe. The mix, some productivity improvements and so on, I am trying to get a better handle on what maybe more permanent and long lasting, obviously mix can shift but what do you see out there in terms of heading more permanent increase in type of gross margins. The productivity improvements I think are ones that will stay with us. Graeme Rein Bares Capital Just looking at your cash flow generation. So it’s going to be very modest whatever we spend on the equipment next year it will again comeback to weather our confidence level of what's going forward, we’ll tell us we should go ahead and straighten out some of our building needs or whether we shouldn’t. Norman Asbjornson Yes, I gave the backlog here a little bit ago, its $67,110,495 million as of June 30, okay and that’s for all three facilities. If we were to break it down, the backlog is pretty much steady in the Tulsa facility from the year-ago; the backlog is up from the year-ago and now it’s about balanced out on the Longview facility and that all the short fall in backlog is connected to our Canadian facility and by that our short fall what I’m talking about, I also mentioned that we’re down by $10 million in backlog for last year and virtually all of that that’s in backlog is in Canadian facility. Kathy Sheffield On the share buyback, Frank. Norman Asbjornson Well we are fortunate Joe, I’ve been in the industry an awful long time and the industry acted very immaterially for many, many years. We have small, let’s say fast food store that we’ve done for one of the big national fast food people and we’re having a hard time coming to grips with it, but we have a lot of the energy saving going on at the meter. And then, Norm how does the order growth look in July and the first part of August are you still comfortable with how that’s progressing? We had done well, as you can see from our numbers that are holding our own, but not gaining great grounds, but considering that it is a pretty competitive environment we are living in w are very pleased with it. Corey McCullum GMP Capital Just two housekeeping questions here and one would just be if you have a backlog number and then two if there is a breakdown on your top-line growth here between price and units for the past quarter, I’ll hang up and listen. So, we think if that’s going to be very good, one of the catches is as we don’t clearly have any production line set up for it yet, if fact its going to be put up in the new building. The thing that we think is going to be our big help to improve our competitive situation is what we are doing with energy and with better quality product. If the customer wanted it shipped in six weeks, we shipped it in six weeks and so, consequently we didn’t get the backlog build up because of our inability to ship. Kathy Sheffield I’m sorry, but I don’t have any numbers to break it down for you. With the equipment we’ve been buying and the things we’ve been changing, we didn’t have that occur to this year. Norman Asbjornson We started out as I’ve mentioned that in the first quarter that we had kind of a weak order input and has modestly improved since that time and still appears to be modestly better than it was a year ago, whether it’s more than our price increases very much, it’s not a lot more than the price increases, but it does appear to be a little bit more than what our price increases would reflect from year-to-year. We were able to ship when they wanted it which from a standpoint of the healthy company is obviously more attracting because the customer after, will satisfy hem ultimately, we’ll give them more business them even if we’ve always a little bit late with our shipments. Kathy Sheffield Okay, well it’s kind of hard number to give an exact number to Frank, because there is so many things that feed into that number based upon the buyback stock option exercises the market price, but if were to through a dart it we would guess approximately $18 million by the end of the year. Kathy Sheffield Yes. If people really want to get serious about energy, we’re there with them and we can do something for them. We’ve built 60% of normal very advanced energy saving ideas that they’ve been wanting to do. We’ve had an improved situation from that last price increase and if you were to draw two curves they are going to cross here someplace, exactly where I don’t know, but we’ve got a little more costs price increase than what we’ve used up, again costs increases right as up this moment in time, but that’s obviously switching everyday that goes by and we will be running behind and our costs increases that we put in back in may want be adequate for what we’ll be shipping here in another month or so and then we will have another one going in, and it will go through the similar type of the cycle. Kathy Sheffield No, Graeme, they really isn’t. We are in a point weather if we felt it was necessary we could run on a very low CapEx if we had to, f we think that the things still look pretty good and things are going to go forward fairly well, we’ve got to build another section of our building up, because we’re stressed out pretty well on the warehouse for purchase material, we’ve got a lot of that stuff in fact sitting outside as a matter of fact and that we don’t feel comfortable with that. Kathy Sheffield 14, for the quarter. Jon Braatz Kansas City Capital Will some of those cost increase that are coming, will that influence the profitability on some of the orders that are in the backlog. Norman Asbjornson No, we put out a preproduction run of the whole quantity of three for about 50 sum thousand dollars so far and we’ve continue to finish off and get everything better for manufacturing of it. It doesn’t appear to be heading one way or another that we can notice and as I expressed earlier, my big long range concern has to do with this possibility of the United States basically being unionized, that worries me tremendously, but beyond that we have optimism that for sure we’re going to do like we said and we’re going to have a strong third quarter and as far as we can see, it will be a record breaking year for us in both volume and bottom line. We analyzed everything we were doing about how could we do it better, and we found a number of ways to do things better and that’s what gave us the productivity increase which means we have dint need the people as madly, so the people shortage or the peoples ability to grow from people did not really heard us very much, it’s basically been the market conditions that’s held us where we are volume wise. Kathy Sheffield Thank you, Cory. We have meetings with them about this, because we are from an energy standpoint more capable apparently in their opinion than anybody else could do what they think needs to be done, so they’re buying that from us which ultimately wouldn’t say that if somebody else can copy what we’re doing and do it cheaper then you won’t get the business that they choose to go forward with which appears they are going to go. The labor thing had us deeply worried for a long time because in Oklahoma, area which is where more of our stuff is built. It looks real good until you get picking up the overhead part of that company and then it doesn’t looks so good."

It's much longer, much more volume capable line than we have before and, therefore, we had a little bit of a startup issue with it. We did also, in the West facility, extend two other production lines making them longer and spent some money doing that and disrupted our production a little bit. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good morning. But we are continuing to resolve a number of issues that allows productivity improvement in the company in Tulsa. We also, even though we did not get a price increase, have not had one since 2008, we have been able to offset largely the cost increases, which have occurred over the past two years through increased productivity as well as a little bit of cost reduction in some of the new products that we've come out with. Our current ratio, asset ratio is 2:1 and capital expenditures were $6.5 million primarily for equipment purchases to set up manufacturing lines for the Tulsa building addition. We still have two production lines operating on the East facility, which in the future will have to be revamped to give us additional capacity there for future years. This facility where we moved the product out of there to move it over to the West facility made available some space, which we’ve put our newest product into production on and it, like the ones on the West side is a very long line for the unit and will allow us to have considerable volume increase as years go forward on all of those production lines. The only one or the major ones that aren't related to housing starts probably would be manufacturing facilities. And so there are issues in the Longview facilities are related to increasing capability to produce the product that they're getting orders for. We do have additional production facilities to be installed in the West facility as future time allots and requires. The gross margin percentages decreased due to several factors, lower sales, high raw material costs and a onetime charge related to expenses associated with the moving of one of our production lines from our East manufacturing facility to our West manufacturing facility, and also setting up additional production lines in the new Tulsa West building addition. We met all our customer ship dates but it did cost us some overtime and it cost us a lot of other things associated with the move. And I'd like to introduce our CFO, Kathy Sheffield. We did not miss any production. We have, however, since the move passed that point and we are now running at more productivity on that line than we were in the East facility. We, therefore, anticipate that as time goes on, these other products, which would have been subsequently introduced as mentioned, will start finding a similar acceptance and gain market share for us due to the advanced technologies and energy-saving features that these products contain. It immediately did not start paying off because it was a new production line and had to have the bugs worked out on it. And we anticipate further improvement as we make additional adjustments to our methods that are available to us with this new product and new production line. We anticipate the Longview facility because it has grown from last year to this year in new orders. We have additional equipment on order. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated.","But we've made financial commitments to buying this equipment and everything. We feel comfortable enough that we have continued ordering some additional equipment to be received, a lot of this equipment won't be received until next year. But as I'd say, caution that with the fact that normally the last half of the year, our new orders is weaker than the quarter we just are finishing. We're not being faced with any moving costs or any real big unusual costs going forward and as long as nothing gets out of bounds on raw material cost or purchase costs, I think that our productivity will pretty much from here on and the rest of the year should offset any minor cost increases we get. It has come in at different times so far but as of the day we speak today, we're just a few dollars and I mean a few dollars ahead of last year in new orders. I see the material drop from, in 2009, just trying to gauge how that works in terms of 2010? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Yes, I got the backlog on June 30 of $50,916,000 and the order position so far this year is virtually identical to last year. Could you give us a picture of how order trends played out throughout the quarter and throughout the month of July? Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Scott, the decrease was primarily from three areas. I wanted to get a sense of how seasonal, how controllable that would be in terms of third quarter 2010? We did -- what we spend our time doing is making sure we did it as efficiently as possible and with the least amount of disruption to our customers. So that would give us a little promise that we might be experiencing an upturn in new orders. And also, can you put some dollar amounts around those moving costs you discussed, as well as the startup costs for those new production lines? Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Yes. And we went into the year with this year and therefore, we have lesser shipments last year in the first half of the year than we had in the first half of this year. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC And then second question, just in terms of the order trends. The ones that were introduced last fall and early this spring, we expect them to make more money going forward as we get more efficient in building them. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Sure, Cory. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Okay, thank you. It looks like, if Kathy's figure of $1 million on the onetime cost there of the production move, if that's anywhere accurate, it looks like your gross margins came in high 25s, which is still down from the first quarter. We've taken a little bit more aggressive financial position with that product line to try and get it introduced in the marketplace, more rapidly and more efficiently. As I look at some of your major competitors' big plan to be up mid-single digits to high- single digits in sales for the quarter, and the AHRI [Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute] data for unitary shipments going of commercial size seem to be flattish in the quarter. We now probably have exceeded the 50% market on our product line selling into the replacement market as opposed to new construction. The difference in our bottom line and our performance is all related to the fact that in 2009, we went into the year with a bigger backlog. The strongest part of our booking year is usually the second quarter and it was a strong quarter, relatively speaking this year. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Right now, we will probably diminish that share repurchase because we've gone into buying of equipment again. Question and Answer Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from DeForest Hinman with Walthausen & Co. DeForest Hinman Paradigm Capital Management Can you give us an update on the current backlog and also the orders booked for the second quarter? Because I noticed in 2009, there is a material step down in terms of SG&A. Considering new construction is continuing to decline or stabilize/decline, the environment is still weak out there and given that your business sort of lags given that you install an HVAC unit at the end of constructing a building. Whereas commercial construction has, for the industry as a whole, been somewhere around the 50% market on replacement versus new construction. But as far as new orders in the door, we are roughly identical with both last year and this year. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer There was, as Norman mentioned, there was labor involved both in keeping the shipments going and the move, and there were also some other costs associated with that. It looks like your backlog's up about $4 million over last year. Our strength originally in the company was primarily all in new construction and replacement has grown as the years have gone by. Residential I'm not in, but my understanding of the residential market is it's a very high percentage of replacement markets, somewhere up in the 70s probably compared to new construction. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC So would you say, like new construction is down like 15% and the Replacement business is offsetting that by being up like 10%? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO There's no question that we're getting a higher percentage of replacement market than the new construction and it has been historically the case for our company."

The net result of all of that is we have prepurchased, and it is not in our financial sheets, a lot of material which will be used up over the next few months, primarily, I think, almost entirely by the end of this year. That being said, we finally are seeing a situation, at least in the statistics that are present at this time, of a possible turn in new construction and a fairly healthy replacement market giving us in total a nice growth. It gives you the picture that finally we've reached the bottom in the building construction market somewhere in the May, June, July timeframe, and hopefully, it will continue to move upward. The next ones, which are the lower productivity caused by adverse temperature conditions are extremely difficult to measure. The market has been -- the new construction market has been in a long-term decline ever since hitting a high, back in 2007, December of 2007. I think it probably cut back production $4 million to $5 million. The gross profit percentage has decreased due to a number of factors which include excess manufacturing supplies, that we purchased in advance to avoid price increases; higher cost of raw material and component parts, which we were unable to pass on to our customers in the form of a price increase; lower productivity of workers and equipment caused by an adverse temperature condition resulting from previously reported storm damage to the roof of our Tulsa facility; and also to the manufacturing problems related to productions facility's rearrangement. And that is going to have a very, very significant impact upon our ability to produce product at a cost-effective manner. And we are now seeing the beginning of an upturn, which according to NAAHL, all the nonresidential construction began in February of this month -- of this year. I shouldn't use the word inventory because it's expensed items. Our current ratio was 1.7:1, which was affected by an increase in inventories of $11.8 million due to purchasing additional inventory to avoid impending price increases and capital expenditures of $25.6 million. That plus the winds that came along with it overloaded our roofs and broke some very large holes in the roofs. I would like to introduce Kathy Sheffield, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have gone up in our backlog through the second quarter by 35%, when compared to the second quarter of last year. Well this year, the commodity costs have moderated compared to last year. And so that's not on our balance sheet, but it is in our control, and we will use it. And also based upon cost of holding that beyond just the capitalized cost, the cost of our facility and everything, whatever we're using up. We don't anticipate any -- most any of them other than ongoing cost of the components and the raw material to be with us. To that extent, what we have done in that arena, we have put out about $25.9 million worth of capital goods, the majority of which is for new equipment and only a portion of it is for building, which is of course capitalized on a long-term depreciation schedule. That, coupled with the size of our backlog and the fact that we are booking new business at a very considerable rate, the increase of the 19% I mentioned earlier, gives me great hope for the future. Precisely where, it is yet to be determined because so many price increases are folded in there, that are just starting to flow through that it is going to be difficult to tell until we actually see them flow through to know precisely. We will be liquidating our inventory and going back pretty close to where we were coming into the year by the end of this year. One is the capitalized items such as you see in our inventory sheet, which is up considerable, approximately $12 million. But the pass-through of those commodity costs as they affect component costs are still being passed through, and they were rather significant. How much did it cost us in production, if I had just a rough guess on it? As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control, that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. So since educational is almost twice as large a market as any one of the others I mentioned and then I add in there manufacturing, which was up substantially, about 4% between those 2 months -- $4 million, I should say. We have had price increases of up to 10% on some components, major components and possibly quite a bit more than that on some small ones. So the necessary cost of expenditure for reengineering product is largely behind us. We are of the opinion that most of our backlog now, which is carrying all these price increases and has just started flowing through during the month of July in real big quantities, is going to bring our profitability back to a reasonable level compared to where we have been in the past. What this amounts to is we have been moving production lines around in the building to give them more productivity and longer lines which will allow us to build more product. Straight copper, in other words the copper that we buy in straight lengths that we use to pipe up the machine is expensed. It's almost -- it's up around $1.7 million, $1.8 million of excess inventory on purchase. That being said, the last thing I need to discuss has to do with our rearrangement of our plant, and the rearrangement of the plant is all intended to give us 2 benefits: one, an increased productivity; and two, an ability to handle considerably more volume. The good part is that most of that is behind us, and there's a lot of good backlog there that is priced higher than what we've been producing. We are in the process of one of the biggest revitalizations of a company that you could possibly go through. The third positive thing is that the price increases which we have had, have been passed through and are in place and are largely represented in our backlog. And the net result is some of our sheet metal equipment overheated, as well as the cost of the productivity slowdown from people having to work in that kind of a climate. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Thank you, Norm. Now in going through some of the other items which are affecting us, besides that, we listed in our announcement that the excess costs because of what we prepurchased on expense items and the raw material and the component parts, those were, we believe, slightly less cost additions to us in the first 6 months, down around $1.6 million or $1.7 million, than was the expense items.","But sometimes they don't go forward with the actual construction if they don't feel good by the time they get the building designed to be built. Because when you have a structural failure in the roof, what you have to do is bring in a consulting engineer or structural engineer who first has to analyze the roof, and this was -- the part that's collapsed was some probably 70 or 80 years old. And the contractor installing it is in the process of installing it. Jonathan Paul Braatz Kansas City Capital Associates In particular, what component parts have moved up the most in terms of pricing? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Well, we deal with a lot of architects and consulting engineers and everything who see day to day how much work they're doing, and they have turned up in the work they're doing. And the fact that the new construction is starting to make a turn right now, based upon the statistics from the federal government, gives me hope that maybe we're going to be swinging back into new construction market will start climbing again. Now on positive cash flow, of course, I mentioned that we've got too much inventory around here. And it has long-range benefits because we opened some specifiers’ eyes that they didn't realize that we have the capability we have. The problem we've had with it is because this is not a big structural steel job, it is a small job to a structural steel company, it's a small job to the consulting engineer. There's always a lag on components due to -- when basic commodities go up, there's a lag between when they can put their price through to us, just like there's a lag for us putting a price through to our people. I mean, in terms of getting in those, I believe they were engineers, to kind of look at the product. And I think you'd given some CapEx guidance in the past, and it seems like we've had a pretty good amount of that full year fiscal year '11 amount spent in the first half, and we've had some prebuy on inventory. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Yes, we've had a little over 100, I mean, up to the $100,000 more. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Well, it's really hard for us to judge because we don't, on taking orders, ask them to tell us whether it's new construction or replacement. In the case of -- what we did, for instance, we have some very large pressure vessels that contain 40,000, 50,000 pounds of refrigerant, and we have 3 of those around here. As energy grows, it's going to become a bigger factor. Can you kind of talk about your expectations for that free cash flow or what you expect to use that for? Now, they typically -- I think, they perhaps last 45 to 50 days, something like that before we have to fill them again. So it sounds like potentially in the second half we have some cash flow coming into the company. We have set a goal in how successful we'll be -- generally, I think we can do it -- of cutting our inventory by $10 million by the end of the year. But the ones that we bought the most of were up in the 7% to 10%, the motors and compressors, on those inventoried items. And last question, just regarding the geothermal units that you're manufacturing. Now here is the part of it, the marketplace, as we know divides into replacement market and new construction, and new construction has been where our biggest strength is because our biggest strength is to owners and owners are the one in the new construction that determine it by and large more so than they do in the replacement. We filled all of those up to the fill. Is that the thought process? Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC A lot of construction companies like McGraw-Hill and such are predicting somewhat of a pretty strong rebound considering, in 2012, in new construction. Jonathan Paul Braatz Kansas City Capital Associates In order to earn that additional depreciation, do you have to have that, let's say, that air-conditioning unit installed by year end or just simply ordered by year end? First off, on the point that you made in terms of, I guess, advanced purchasing of certain materials or components. And the reason we aren't is because we don't build stuff for stock, and we don't have distributors sitting all over United States with stuff in stock, which is what those who focus on the replacement market do have. So we have an excess in 2 things, both in our inventory, that $12 million a lot of that is that excess that is inventory. Sometimes what happens and the hard part to judge is sometimes people will go ahead and contract with an architect and an engineer to design a building, and they'll go ahead and put that much money into planning on building the building. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC How much was the sort of average price increase that you were seeing from those suppliers? They are working seriously on it, and the materials are all starting to appear. I'm of the opinion that because they are quite considerably advanced in some aspects, the biggest one from a standpoint of a hard one for someone to emulate, one of our competitors to follow, would be our double-wall foam construction, which improves the insulating value of the cabinet on our product by not a small amount, by a large amount all the way from an R-Value of down about 2 or 3 to an R-Value of 13 to 15, in other words, 5x, 4 or 5x better insulated cabinet than we used to have and that our industry generally has. And so he had to start all over again and re-engineer what was up there, totally redo it and figure out how to fix it before he could even design the material and then give that to a structural steel company who build the things. There is quite a bit of activity out there. And so all that will help us in the cash flow and then the rest of it will be primarily in profit that we generate from here on out the rest of the year. Same would be true of the foam, which we also filled up large vessels full. And our suppliers in that aren't going to be getting a lot of business for quite some time because we have a big stock of motors and compressors here. We kind of fill in to whenever they got around to doing our job. It's not inventory but it is here and will be used in this year, the balance of the year. Our competitors who are more -- those who are more in tune with the replacement market who focus on the replacement in lieu of the new construction probably had a better deal than we did in that respect."

We, basically, in order to get a better understanding of what is occurring for AAON, I have been -- I think break it down or talk about what the market place is doing, and then after that I'll enter in and talk about what AAON is doing, and then we'll kind of combine the 2 together as best we can. And then in the last 5 months, in August, it fell below the 50 -- below what we did in 2010 and continued below through the rest of 2011 in bookings -- new orders. At best, in the total for the year, in my opinion, it's somewhat, as I've discussed earlier about the new construction, it's somewhat going to be a balance for the renovation market too, with it skewed a little bit toward the first part of the year. The speculative-type construction suffered more of that recession that 37% fall back. Please note that in making comparisons today, it's important to remember that 25,000 square feet of our manufacturing facility roof did not fall in on this year. The timing of it is a little bit different, depending upon where it fell in there, so the timing of when we get that available [ph] business, it could be different, but that is only the beginning point of our new construction. That product manufacturer has been upgrading the details, but it's kind of like an automobile. There will be -- some of it will drag out much longer than that, but the vast majority of that 30% will be operable sometime over the next year, 1.5 years. So that new production or that new product that we produced enhanced, in my opinion, and other things we were doing of improving our sales operations and everything, improved our takeaway market share. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good afternoon. But a heavy influenced on efficiency, life cycle, maintainability, [Audio Gap] mixed into other things, which caused you to own it. We still have about 30% of our products to go through and upgrade, and we're in the process of doing that at the present time. Now I've got to -- in order for you to kind of put a feel for what I just talked about, you've got to understand that our industry is not a rapidly changing industry. As you can see, it's a pretty complex thought process at least in my mind that I run through here, trying to figure out what's going on. The owners and the consulting engineers, they imply -- many times will tell you, it sounds like a wonderful idea. So we ended up shipping a lot, and particularly, in the month of June when all of that was wanted by the customers. The new construction market is best typified and predicted by what is called the Architectural Billing Index. We are, on dollar-wise, on new products -- approximately 70% of our dollars shipment are in these new products that we created over the past 3 or 4 years. So at that point, we lose control over our ability to view it. And I'd like to introduce you to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Sheffield, who will give us the first part of the report. Revenues increased primarily as a result in gains and market share and new commercial and industrial construction, as well as the replacement markets and the favorable reception to our new and redesigned projects. The net result in trying to put a projection in -- for you people to try and figure out where AAON's going and what it's going to do, you have to think about the 2 things. Well, majority of the marketplace and the majority of the people supplying that marketplace are pursuing the cost market, first cost market. In trying to determine the difference between those 2, to get it [ph] to tell us whether we can anticipate more or less business from new construction this year is what -- the use, the value that has. As you'll note, our 62% -- or $62 million in backlog was a little higher than it was the preceding year in 2011. The increase in gross profit is attributable to improved productivity from our new sheet metal fabrication equipment and our revamped production lines. But that being said, the marketplace has absorbed -- or the order desk has absorbed, I think, the majority of the replacement market that people really wanted to push forward. And contained within it was 100% write-off of qualified capital investments for the year 2011 on anything that was entered into and on the contract, completed and put into operation during the year 2011 could have 100% write-off of it. After the drawings are done and construction documents and everything are completed, the owner has to make a determination of about when to enter into a contract and put it out for bid, et cetera, so it's still distorted even further. And we have, ever since we began this process 24 years ago, we've been taking market share fairly consistently, not always but over the long term, we have. And what occurred in 2012 was that all of the orders or a large percentage of the orders that people wanted to have billed and shipped and take the 50% depreciation allowance were given to us in the first 3 months. Going into 2012, because these people who didn't get to participate and get into 2011, were all set up to participate in 2012. This is the beginning point for all of our new construction, because if somebody doesn't design the building, nothing else happens. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control, that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. And then from 2008 through 2011, we went, market wise if you look at our field -- at our numbers, we went down by 5% in this business. As stated by those [ph] people, when they bill that billing, it actually ends up in construction contracts approximately 9 to 12 months later. There's the new construction market, then there's the renovation market. So if you look at the marketplace, it's not a real winner for us in the construction industry. Our current asset ratio was 1.9 to 2, which was affected by an increase that we had in inventories of about $4.2 million due to purchasing additional inventory to accommodate the increase that we had in our backlog and also due to an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $17.9 million, which was due to our increase in revenue. The net result was we saw an upswing in new orders -- a large upswing in the first 7 months of 2011. But fundamentally, we're pursuing the value-added market, which means energy efficiency, it means maintainability, it means life cycle and also, of course, it may -- it's first cost is mixed into it. If we look at the most recent one I have available to me, which is June of this year, and try and decipher how much of the line was above the 50% and how much was below in the 2 preceding things, here's kind of the analysis that I've arrived at in trying to best judge their comparative values. It's also contained the provision that anything that was entered into contract, shipped, installed or, and whatever and used in 2012 would get a 50% write-off if you wish to choose for it. So that kind of established what we had in order flow for us to build and ship.","There's a considerable concern in certain geographical areas in the United States over making buildings as earthquake proof as they can make them, and therefore, they are setting standards about the ability of the equipment to operate after it's been subjected to an earthquake shake. And the equipment that we bought, the new sheet metal and the building we did and the remodeling of our production facilities and everything did have a negative on us last year without a question. But we did in July of this year, ship to a major manufacturer of both defense and commercial products about over $1.5 million worth of the replacement units for a factory. Is there any way that you could quantify how much the gross margin was driven related to productivity improvements versus just the increased volume? So basically, what most of our forward-going right now has to do with cost reductions and productivity improvements? So from a cash flow standpoint, it did -- it's going to be impacted by some of what we did last year, as well as what we're doing this year. I'm going to say that 80% of it was due to improved productivity and 20% -- and I am searching a little here, Joe. The story is all over in the purchase of the manufacturing components. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO I think we're still running somewhere in the upper 50% area on replacement compared to new construction. I think we will be able to maintain price increases equal to our cost increases, but neither of them are a very big thing in life right now. We've kind of moved past the heavy investment period, and we had a nice sales number and we got some receivables that are probably flowing through in the third quarter. They're having -- they're trying to improve them, their operation, pushing forward. There's been a surprising little bit more activity over in the manufacturing, particularly in that area of the arena that -- but it was -- it had really deteriorated very badly, and it is showing some surprising strength. And it's diminishing until the picture changes in the economy and tells me I've got to do something else, because in so many areas now whether it be the equipment or the buildings or anything else, where I would normally spend capital money, it's going to require that we have a bigger marketplace and more sales before I'm going to be going forward. Namely, the cost of gas has gone down considerably and, therefore, anything, any other source of energy has -- they could be displaced by gas is having a tough competitive situation, because the gas price available to you and I is considerably less than it was just a couple of years ago. The commodity portion of the marketplace has gone nowhere. You don't gain anything on the cooling side, but in geothermal, you do so it is probably -- on more of the southern part of the United States is probably holding its own better against this lower cost gas than it is in the more northern climates, where you were trying to gain on the heating side. DeForest R. Hinman Walthausen & Co., LLC So should we as shareholders anticipate continued buyback activity, or should we anticipate some cash buildup? Jonathan Paul Braatz Kansas City Capital Associates Norm, can talk a little bit about the price environment at the moment and cost pressures, I know sometimes you get hit by some component cost increases, and you need to pass those on. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC Do you have an idea of what the sort of current breakout, I guess, in the first half of the year was for new construction demand versus replacement as a percent of sales? Jonathan Paul Braatz Kansas City Capital Associates Norm, looking back at all the manufacturing enhancements you've made, the new sheet milling equipment and so on, do you think you've -- like this quarter, did you capture the full benefit of those investments? Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer It's just the classification on the cash flow statement between operating and investing income based upon capital expenditures that are reclassed -- that are sitting in accounts payable, some that were sitting there at the end of June and some that were sitting there at the end of the year. And we are right up either in the lead or right up with the leaders in the energy segment of our product line. And the one that you can see it in is air-source heat pumps, which have historically been growing at faster rate than air-conditioning equipment as a whole have now gone the other way. And, of course, the energy thing is playing a huge benefit in that. So geothermal, back to your question, geothermal, I think, is because it still does have a real virtue of being able to dump heat into the ground and do it in a very energy-saving fashion, that part of the equation still exists, which is an electrical-driven cost that it's saving on your electricity as opposed to saving on gas, natural gas cost, which you could have done with heating -- with natural gas."

We have pretty high ambitions but, from your standpoint of guessing what we should do, that's up to you to try and decide as to what you believe we're capable of doing. Income from operations increased 24.0% to $27 million or 17.1% of sales from $21.8 million or 14.7% of sales. The new construction market continued to be weak compared to last year. We basically compete in 7 different parts of the market: Lodging, office, commercial, health care, educational, religious and manufacturing. We did have a downturn from the end of the first quarter when we had over $70 million, so we have eaten up some of our backlog. It's just that it won't be in the magnitude that the first half of the year was because the market isn't supporting it at this point in time on new order input. We need to recognize that the -- and long-term indicator on new construction, which is the Architect's Billing Index has turned around in the fall of last year and, according to historical data, precludes or predetermines what's going to happen 9 to 12 months later. However, on new orders that worked because of taking market share, we will continue to get growth on a year-to-year basis. And so, I'd now like now to look at the backlog. We basically, as has been discussed previously, expended most of our capital needs and we're filling in gaps now, some of them we haven't gotten filled as quickly as we should. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside of AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. The incoming order rate has slowed. So we're just entering the time when we should get a boost in new construction compared to last year. Revenues increased due to gains in market share in the new commercial, industrial, construction and replacement markets and the result of price increases introduced in May 2012 and April 2013. Income from operations increased 31.4% to $18.6 million or 20.4% of sales from $14.2 million or 17% of sales. The improvement in gross margins can be attributed to decreases in raw material costs and increased product prices. So the march forward continues on and we're pretty optimistic that if the marketplace will just hold steady, we will do well. Our backlog on 6/30/13 was $66.2 million versus $62.2 million a year ago.","Well, at that point in time, the market consisted of a purely standardized product group of companies and customized group of companies and they were very different in capabilities, very different in price, very different in all aspects and we went down between them. There's more activity now than there has been. We hear from it because our representatives are calling on consulting engineers to get our product laid out, and so they're telling us that they're fairly active at the engineering level. The construction environment has been pretty much year-over- year negative slightly in the second quarter. Just wondering if you have any idea of that 6%, 7%, what new construction was like versus replacement? They haven't really been able to close the gap between the customer and the production line manufacturers of 25 years ago, which is where we are precisely. And that is an extraordinarily difficult change for anybody, whether it would be the custom people or the production line people to try and get into the market we're in, because it's a total different way of organizing your company. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC So your products are generally priced higher than most of the market, but generally, the quality and the sort of the options within the products are much better than the competitors. Do you get any indication ahead of time in terms of maybe some order flow that, in terms of your products, that would suggest that we're actually going to see a pickup in construction? Now the way you go down between them, is you have to adopt a different methodology for manufacturing products than what they were doing 25 years ago. They obviously have invested money in the architectural work and the engineering work, but the actual signing of the contact to move it forward, they seem to get a little hesitant. So we see a positive sign because there is a lot of activity out there relative to -- I shouldn't say a lot. Plus we managed to do some fairly significant amount of additional efficiency gain on the amount of products that we got out the door with the manpower we had and the people, all the way from salaried personnel to hourly personnel, have worked well for the month. So if I'm looking at a line of all your products versus your competitors', is it generally -- it's generally fair to say, cost per quality is just above and beyond most of your competitors? And the balance of it was probably due to more stable replacement market, which means it grew slightly compared to the new construction market. And our world is in between the 2 of them and we are delivering more quality because that's part of what we're -- we're not a price-driven company, we're a value-driven company. And that's a different way to approach a market, approaching it with the total value of energy efficiency, longevity, maintainability, as well as first cost, as opposed to being primarily a first cost and the other thing things trailing along somewhere behind. I would like to say though, the -- and the people who are in the production end of it, the company is doing an extremely good job of delivering a good product -- less capable, less quality a little bit in some aspects, than what we do. We are running down the middle of that and it's been a very popular part of the market for a whole host of reasons because the customers can get more what they want and not have to pay the price of a custom unit than they can get it in a production line product."

And we expect to have a good fourth quarter for this reason as far as orders coming in. The net result, however, is that the orders that we took before that time period had to be shipped and are still being shipped out of that facility today. And as we've grown and we’ve had to choose sometimes between our customers because of our limitations on production capability, we've tended to go toward the general market, a little bit away from the national accounts for a number of reasons. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ substantially from those anticipated. In the Tulsa operation, as I mentioned with the numbers I have given you here, we have an input of orders which tells us we're picking up speed again in the Tulsa facility. However, on the other side of the situation, a problem which we mentioned in the release this morning has to do with the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar, plus the operation of the Canadian facility. Some of that we couldn't turn around, because since the orders didn't come in during July, we couldn't ship them out. The orders for the air handler that we started building down there haven't grown as fast as we thought, as early as we thought. And we had an unexpectedly low booking month in July, as compared to our June booking. I would say that from my experience, right now, the trend of the industry, not talking about AAON, but just talking about the industry, would tell me that commercial construction is probably going to slowdown somewhere maybe to little or no growth, and even possibly becoming a little bit negative. To give you some percentages that reflect what happened, over the four-month period, starting from the end of June in the 1st of July through the end of October, our total input of orders was up 12.9% even with that weak month of July. Expenditures were related to new equipment purchased to increase production efficiency and also to some renovations to our Tulsa facility. Now how does all of that affect my perception of what AAON has the capabilities of doing? We wouldn't have shipped hardly in August, but we would have shipped a fair number of them in September if we had the manpower or setup to do so. Its niche marketing and we're filling a niche that is, in our opinion, needs to be filled. If we just take the three months and discount the July numbers altogether, in the last three months, our orders compared to 2006 were up 44.5%. Now then, we were booking business in the Canadian facility very well in the first part of the year anticipating that we were going to speed the facility up. So if we take an order in the United States for $1 and when we took it, we thought we were going to exchange it for $1.20 or something in Canadian dollars. So it became obvious that we weren't going to meet the revenue numbers we were trying for, and so we started slowing the order input down at the end of March, and we did that by increasing prices. Regarding August, all of a sudden the situation reversed itself, and these anticipated orders started coming in and we were moving forward at a brisker pace. If I go down to all of our product lines one-by-one and look at the growth from year-to-year, it's obvious that one of our big growth factors are units which we did introduce four or five years ago, mainly our larger tonnage equipment, which includes large tonnage rooftop units, water chillers and large tonnage condensing units. We were talking to our representatives who said they have plenty of jobs they were sure they were getting, but for whatever reasons the contractors weren't placing the orders as fast as it was anticipated. Now, from an operational standpoint, a couple of questions sometimes are asked. Those of you who have been listening to us for quite sometime, know that being a very limited customer-based company over the years to becoming a much broader-based, and through that cycle we went through a lot of national accounts in big time. Kathy Sheffield Good afternoon and welcome to our conference call. The operation of the Canadian facility continued to be less than anticipated and not making money during the three months.","So we could put overtime into the equation if we get that to thinking that this continuation of the order input goes up that will happen. Because of the pricing levels that were occurring in some of that national account, we chose not to take the orders at the price level that they were taken at. I want to thank you, and in summary, leave you with the idea that, yes, we've got an issue to be addressed to get the Canadian operation corrected in some fashion. Kathy Sheffield Of all three programs. And if I've heard you right, you would have shipped about $73 million or $74 million in the quarter. Could you help us out a little bit in looking at your markets, what percentage of your revenue is now replacement versus new construction? The market now is stronger and we have the capability now of building more product. So there are three companies, three major companies that are direct sales force, I would say, and two who are primarily distributor-oriented. It was slowing and it was (inaudible) to not take orders that shouldn't be profitable. Depending upon the arrival of the couple of pieces of equipment for our coil facility, we will be in the $10 million range plus or minus a little bit perhaps this year. The problem with it is that because we have that large backlog, which we're still working out, the new dollar or the new orders at improved pricing, as we've raised the price since March, have not flown through to the bottomline. The bad thing is a distributor cost more than a direct sales force. So they have chosen to go that way and a couple of major manufacturers are that way. We are, however, more strong in the new construction than the people who have decided to go with distribution or with distributors since there are sales force out there. <TAG>Frank Magdlen - The Robbins Group</TAG> And I guess I'm more encouraged from your talking about the order rate. So on a cash flow basis, the depreciation and the CapEx are going to be about the same area. It slowed down the order input, which was -- normally we would go and do that. We know what has impacted our ability to get orders. Yeah, I was talking orders a moment ago, and just a moment, we're going to be probably at $15 million in shipments. And we're improving the air-moving efficiency, the way we're going to move the air will take less horsepower, as well as well the cooling of the air takes less horsepower. If I had to guess, I would say we're going to be down somewhere around 40% on orders from what we were last year. A quick question what percent of your mix would you consider counter-cyclical in nature? And so they probably runs counter to the building construction cycle because I think more with during those times. Norman Asbjornson Let's talk about what replacement is and then we'll get into new construction. But you missed by about $3 million or $4 million missed sales or missed shipments, because you just didn't have the labor to put it through the factories. And so, we were starting to ramp it back up, but more on standard, regular time and throwing a lot of overtime out. Kathy Sheffield On the shares that we've repurchased…? What has happened on the Canadian orders? Norman Asbjornson You are asking me when I am planning on dying. We didn't want to throw a lot of overtime on it because that July scared us. Norman Asbjornson Although we had more price increase, some of that aren't following through the backlog just fast enough to change that. The unexpected replacement market is best served by those people who have distributors as a source of marketing of their product. <TAG>David Woodyatt - Keeley Asset Management</TAG> What was the backlog a year ago? I'm going to guess right now we're somewhere around 45% replacement and 55% new construction. Kathy Sheffield Yeah. We made a lot of capital investments which have given us the ability to build more than what we're getting in orders right now. Kathy Sheffield On our original stock buyback, it is reflective of the stock split. Kathy Sheffield This total is for both of these programs, same program at just two different times. Norman Asbjornson But we're not going to be taking orders at that rate because of the problems we're having with the exchange rate. But could you help quantify a little bit where the backlog stands now or, say, at the end of the quarter? And so that would be in our 45% or so counter-cyclical for sure, and then certain other portions of it for other peculiar reasons probably kick in and probably get you up to 50% or slightly better. Kathy Sheffield Frank, the numbers I have are available at my fingertips here, have to do more with not just in 2007, but overall and reflect the stocks split. Other major manufacturers, including ourselves, have gone direct route, which is either a factory-owned sales force or independent agency direct sales force. They will start flowing through, and it gives us an indication by what we've gotten from a month that we just closed or closing on October, which we don't have the final numbers on yet, but where we are at this point looks like it might be having some of that impact. The market in general is a little more replacement market than it is new construction. So it's going to reduce the size of our operation because we have to depend upon one or two things, either Canadian orders, which aren't affected by the exchange rate, or those orders which we can get at the higher price in the US. Probably replacement business is counter-cyclical I think, and it probably goes up because what ticked off the contractors and the consulting engineers and everybody who is in the business then redirects their effort toward trying to get more of the replacement business to happen. Some of the other large things that we've introduced and the kind of growth we've gotten out of them, it would appear that on a order booking case, the water chillers which we introduced a few years back are going to our bookings. We're upping the R-value, the energy saving part of the cabinetry by about two to three times better, 200% to 300% better cabinet. We were growing the orders. Kathy Sheffield Yes, February 14th of 2006. There are going to be about 100% growth on bookings this year over last year."

So we included in that machinery purchase some more equipment for that facility to be delivered in the first quarter of next year. All the rest of buildings, commercial, retail, office, manufacturing, lodging, municipalities are fairly good, but a lot of the rest are still looking pretty poor. And therefore, we have more time available to handle it in a more efficient manner and do a better job of buying equipment and planning our forward movement. As such, it is subject to occurrences of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. And so not only are we preparing for future business and being able to handle our present business more efficiently, but we're also doing at a time when we're not being pressed quite so much to increase our production. Our sales for 2010 fourth quarter is going to be better, obviously, than 2009 due to the healthy backlog. In addition to which the products which we had brought out new back in 2008 and first part of 2009 out of our Longview facility, we're also doing extremely well all year and they were starting, even though we had done quite a bit of renovation and expansion of that facility in recent years, we started outrunning our sheet-metal capability down there and needed more sheet-metal capability down there. So that is really, future, that $5 million is basically new product, or new equipment we haven't yet received. They were down compared to the previous year due to the things which she mentioned, which indicates the fact that we've been able to maintain all relative issues within our SG&A at a very good rate even though we've increased our volume, we haven't had a corresponding upswing in SG&A. However, it needs to be remembered that, that backlog is going in there at basically 2008 price levels and might even be a little bit on the weak side of that because we have added some standard features to our product at no additional cost over these past two years. Most everything else on the negative side of it has come about by virtue of cost increases, pretty much led by commodity price increases, which also relates to some increases in purchased finished goods parts, like motors and things of that nature which because they are also heavily impacted by commodities, have started to come through with price increases on those items as well. In order to accomplish that and not lose productivity of our product, we were going to have to overstock the West side with machinery, and so we did. So things are turning but the billing index only talks about what they are doing in the way of designing buildings, and that always has a lag effect before we get to pick up an order for it, up somewhere up toward one year from the time that they start increasing production of buildings simply due to the prime lag of issuing those proposed building improvements or new buildings out into the trade, the bidding off them, and us finally getting an order and getting ready to build the product. So all of these things, we changed our game plan a little bit, added a lot of capital expenditure which we hadn't originally planned on, plus some of the equipment that was available now was better than the equipment which we had anticipated being available when we did choose to buy new equipment. And that's why the backlog has gone up substantially but our sales haven't gone up so much because most of it is a fairly recent time of change into our backlog. That will then allow us to dismember some of the old equipment and begin replacing it on the East side facility of the Tulsa facility. And so we have decided that we could afford to take a chance on losing a little bit of volume and going for some more margin, and we have effective as basically virtually today while we're talking, it's in the process of occurring on new orders coming in the house which of course will be somewhere two to three months before they ship. We are increasing our volume capabilities in that facility which, in turn, is improving productivity of those product lines built in that area. The incoming order rate continues to be much solider than it has been, and we have initiated somewhat of a price increase down into our Longview facility which has gotten most healthy part of that increase backlog. And so it's not a very efficient building plus the equipment that we were manufacturing in was getting old and worn out. We bought, committed to quite a few millions of dollars worth of additional equipment which will not be delivered until the end of this year and the first part of next year, but on which we had to make a down payment of approximately $5 million which is included in our capital expenditures year-to-date. In other words, most of that we were still going down, all the balance of last year from September on through the rest of the year, we were reducing our backlog and the backlog did not start improving until the first quarter got a little bit better but not much, in the second quarter gained speed, the third quarter it gained significant additional speed. In the interim, we are improving margins by improved productivity as we wrap up the West side manufacturing facility in Tulsa, which we're still spending considerable money on doing. The gross margin percentages were narrowed by higher raw material and manufacturing cost, increased labor expenses and our inability to implement price increases given the economic environment. Capital expenditures were $13.1 million related to the completion of our Tulsa building expansion and for equipment purchases to set up additional manufacturing lines in that expansion. Now we have always had an excess of capacity, but the other good thing about a lot of these things that we're talking about right now is they come with an improvement in productivity, and our productivity  has always been a very high thing for us. What we were seeing was fulfilling our expectations of what we were hoping from the new product and was starting to give us increased marketability of our product line. But with our improvement in sales and our substantial improvement in backlog, most of which has been building here in the last few months. And there's a good leading index called the Architectural Billing Index, and that billing index, any time it’s below 50%, indicates a continued downturn in the amount of hours and dollars billed by the architectural firms in the United States which would say that we're going to have fewer architects design buildings available for selling equipment. However, we did receive a tax benefit in the third quarter due to an increase in the domestic production activity tax credit from 6% to 9%, higher R&D tax credits than expected with the filing of our 2009 income tax return and bonus depreciation which was reinstated in September of this year. And with that, I'd like to introduce, Kathy Sheffield, our CFO. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Thank you, Norm. We watched that to see and it showed surprisingly a good acceptance and increased relative efficiency of sales compared to our other product lines in the previous product line.","Is there any dollar amounts that you can put on those numbers on the scrap cost and the cost to move that equipment all around in the third quarter? But with the brand-new product -- and extremely, I can't emphasize, extremely big deferential that the product has with three things: One, energy efficiency; number two, two-inch cabinet that is like 10x as good as our value or resistance to heat transfer or insulator, however you want to say it, as our old product line; and be very much higher efficiency direct drive, therefore, lower than we have in the product. The other one is, as I mentioned, which will go on is replacing some of the machinery in the East side of the building in addition to what we've already got on order. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC First question I had, Norm, given the strong backlog that you do have and it was up sequentially compared to June. Thank you and hopefully we're on an upswing and going to be able to give a more optimistic forecast for the future and a much better report of the past in our next quarterly get-together. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC Just to be clear, it sounds like you're not inclined to increase headcount at this point because we've missed some production days because of the holidays. So are we going to just kind of maintain headcount at least in the fourth quarter and have more overtime costs and then re-evaluate next year? It sounds like we had some scrap costs and we're moving around a lot of equipment at the East facility in Tulsa. And it was really almost the beginning of the third quarter when RQ was, both of those costs us some inefficiencies because teaching the people and getting things organized on new products and they had a related cost to them. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO The scrap, I'll give to Kathy, she's better on that than I. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Based upon the scrap, I don't have it for the quarter, but year-to-date we're looking at around $2 million. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO At least a fair share of those were related to the cost of moving people around and equipment around. All of the parts that were obsoleted out of our inventory -- those old parts for the old products were scrapped out. We don't have to do any planning, that's been going on for years and is completed and all ready. I've mentioned we've spent about $5 million on what is approximately $13 million worth of things on order right now so we got another $8 million that's going to be hitting the capital line between now and about the end of the first quarter, early the second quarter next year. The big catch in the fourth quarter being of course the thanksgiving and Christmas vacations which kick quite a few days on the manufacturing schedule. How much more damaged commodities and price increases we’ll have is anybody's guess at this point. So we're going to be limited really by our ability to produce rather than we are by our order backlog. We also had manufacturing expense increases and additional manufacturing expense increases, plus the raw material increases. And if the orders keep coming in, and we get into the first quarter next year, then we will go back to increasing headcount again. And because we're going into the slower part of the year, we don't want to hire a lot of people because the first quarter is normally kind of a weaker quarter, and so we don't want a lot of people on and our ability to turn on over time because of the way we're running the place now which is basically 12 hours a day on assembly and 24 hours on sheet metal is somewhat limited."

Therefore, people felt they had to order in the first half of the year and for the most part, get it shipped in the first half of the year. The older machines, being somewhere between 10 years and 13 years old, and the new machines almost double the productivity of the operator. We did see a falloff in orders from that market right around the middle of the year, apparently because of the fact in order to qualify for it. Thus, what we've had to do in order to offset that is take market share, which we've been able to do fairly well. And the replacement market was primarily implemented by virtue of a December last year tax change, which allowed 100% depreciation on certain qualified assets, which a lot of air conditioning equipment qualified for. Now in total, what this means is we replaced and upped productivity somewhere around 40% of our manufacturing, sheet metal manufacturing equipment. It had the -- products had to be built, shipped, installed and operating by the end of the year to be fully qualified. And if you take that out against 8,760 total hours in a normal year, you can see that we had more in that -- used that equipment quite extensively. The good thing about that is all these new machines, while the old machines were still running pretty well, they were pretty sloppy and their holding of tolerances and everything and they did break down quite often. Unfortunately, everything I see and all the indexes and everything don't tell me that we're going to see a booming economy in the construction industry. And it's down modestly from August, so it is not yet in the recovery mode that commercial and manufacturing are experiencing. The amount of growth is highly questionable at this time, but we are optimistic that we are not going to have to follow the downward or the likely downward trend that the building industry appears to have. So it will be significant on improved productivity next year. As we're going forward now, we're ramping up the construction of the 207,000 square feet of warehouse space that we're putting into this building. We are, however, still shipping some of that product that was ordered in the first half of the year, but it's diminishing rapidly so it's not having a pronounced effect on us, particularly at this point in time. And to give you a feel for this, the warehouse that we have been using overloaded and distributing stuff all over the entire building perimeter and outside into the parking lot and everything, was probably only capable of handling about somewhere in the 30% or 40% of the dollar volume, which we're presently doing. And we now are seeing a modest amount of growth occurring in the manufacturing arena as far as selling heating and air conditioning equipment into that marketplace. So we basically replaced all that older equipment through this year. To the contrary, it says that it's going to be very difficult for the construction industry to match this year's performance. The first part of the year, we were blessed with a substantial increase in replacement market, while the new construction market was pretty soft. And while we were in that market in the tonnage, we were in there with a high-class, highly capable product, which will we will retain for that market. So we're badly overloading our present warehouse, and that's caused us a lot of inefficiency in distributing product, in distributing parts and getting them around. So what I'm kind of seeing occur here at the present time is sort of a stabilizing, a shifting back from the replacement market into the new construction market that does exist. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control, that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. The other very good thing coming along is the fact that this past year, and a little bit over the past year but with a heavy emphasis on this year that we're in right now, we've expended over $30 million in capital expenditures, partially on the building, but more importantly, on our production equipment. And that was due to the fact that when that law was passed last fall, I could not see how I could afford to not replace a lot of badly worn equipment that, although it was still running, it did have a huge amount of operating hours, anywhere from 60-some thousand to almost 100,000 operating hours on it. It will also allow us with -- the new products, which we've been putting into place very rapidly the past few years, to continue to offer to our customers a superior, technologically superior and substantially improved energy-efficient piece of equipment with all the most recent known improvements in this type of equipment. The gross margin continued to be affected by raw material and component part -- price increases, and also by costs associated with the introduction of some new products in our Longview facility. However, at the same time, I'm saying that, there has been, in a few categories, an upswing in new construction. I would like now to turn this over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Sheffield. And the areas where we're experiencing the upturn, based upon the report that we received from the federal government on product put in place in various categories, the places where it's gotten stronger are in commercial construction and then manufacturing, quite a nice experience, I think, to see it happening in manufacturing, which has been on a long-term downturn for several years. The net result of this, even though the new construction market is very modestly down, the backing off of the replacement market is decidedly for the potential sale of products or deterioration in our marketplace. So we're very quickly turning our troubles around from being one of a manufacturing challenge and designing new equipment to being a marketing challenge. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Thank you, Norm. So you can look for an improvement in efficiencies due to this new warehouse coming onstream next year. I'm basically quite optimistic in total for the company, because in all of the things which we've done with the buildings and with the products and with the enhancing of our sales force, we have continued to upgrade our sales force, and things are pretty much on track for what our business plan is.","Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Yes, it should, Joe. But we're in the planning stage on all of those. And how about in terms of the reconfiguration and the upgrading and the manufacturing floor, sort of where are we in that process? Everything is kind of smoothing out now in the operational part. And as long as we aren't getting any great cost increases, it's not too bad because the improved efficiency of the place will give us a little bit of growth in our margin. And we're pretty well loaded that way for November now. The biggest increase probably has been in our component parts. So $0.65 on the dollar basically is what we're putting out of our cash, and the other $0.35 cents, instead of going to the federal government, is going to be purchase of the equipment. Talk about that, talk about your order trends and what kind of margins are you seeing in the orders, in the backlog that you have compared to what you've seen in the past quarter? At this time, I'm kind of planning on somewhere in the area generally of $10 million. The people supplying us motors, compressors, relays and things of that nature. And so in terms of the tax rate, Kathy, should that maintain a 35% going forward indefinitely? Because like I say, we have done all the planning necessary to do some more things to buildings that would enhance our operation and get us some better shape. How about a raw material effects, Norm, how have they been sort of trending in terms of the effects there, and how you do you expect those to play out in terms of what the price increase is and such? Where the big savings is going to occur, Joe, is the fact that I can produce more sheet metal with fewer people and with fewer machines running. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Well, the big, heavy replacement of production lines with new product lines and things of that nature is fairly well accomplished for what we're doing right now. And then in terms of the backlog, it looks like you're up 15% year-over-year. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC First thing I just want to address, the -- so the benefits that you're receiving from investing in all this equipment or anything, is that affecting the P&L?"

Replacement market is very healthy and new construction market was relatively stable compared to the year ago.

Now, of course, if our volume is down, like it normally is in the fourth quarter and the first quarter compared to the second and third quarter, we won't be absorbing our fixed overheads as well, and that will have an effect upon the bottom line marginally. We've expanded our capability there to include parts other than those which are used on AAON products, and this has gained us some significant growth in our parts business and helped give us the 16%, 16.8% for the quarter and the 10.1% for the 9 months. We pretty much uniformly across all of our products had about -- that increase was distributed fairly reasonably between the rooftops, the chillers, air handlers, split systems and the packaged equipment. However, now, with our increased capabilities, we had no problem keeping up. On a month-by-month basis, we've had great consistency on getting the new orders at a higher rate than we did in the corresponding month in the preceding year. We had this due to our redesigned -- our new redesigned products, and the breakdown between new construction and replacement, as near as we can tell, was pretty consistent as far as our increase in market share. Income from operations increased 36.5% to $43.9 million or 17.7% of sales, from $32.2 million or 14.3% of sales. Net sales increased due to gains in market share in the new commercial, industrial, construction and replacement markets as a result of price increases introduced in April 2013. Right now, we haven't, as we said, been experiencing basic cost increases in the way of material. So I would have to say that the market -- the new construction market is starting to heal a little bit more and is likely to be up somewhat. The backlog. So the only big change that we expect to be occurring, which is going to happen over the next 6 months, is we are in the process of going into a new coil concept that is being introduced into our industry that will lower our cost of some of our coils, and that will give us a little less material cost probably being offset on the opposite side by a small amount of cost increase. And so it looks like the replacement market was down more -- and the commercial world was down more than was the stability that was exhibited in the new construction. The market, as it exists, however, the new construction market was, in total, the market that we serve, fairly well level. The outlook, as I said earlier, for next year at this point in time looks to us to be slightly up in the market capabilities, what's out there in the marketplace looks to have healed itself and should have a little bit of positive to it. And connect that to our new products which are gaining strength and gaining market share to us and the new ones which we're going to be announcing over the next few months, I'm optimistic about the growth potential for AAON even in a very slightly improving marketplace. Income from operations increased 62.7% to $16.9 million, or 18.9% of sales, from $10.4 million or 13.5% of sales. The new orders coming in have consistently been running ahead of 1 year ago. And habitually, we're in a marketplace where the second and third quarters are the strong quarters because that's when we normally ship a lot of equipment to the construction market due to the timing of the construction building cycle. The improvement in gross margins can be attributed to decreases in raw material costs and increased product prices. We have had, of course, a slight amount of wage increases, but productivity has been reasonably well offsetting that. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated.","Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Well, what I said was the construction market, new construction market, was virtually flat according to the governmental statistics showing how many dollars are spent on various types of buildings. A component of SG&A that is driven by our performance is our profit sharing number. However, because of the way we build product and the options we give and all the various things we allow our product to do, we felt it necessary to run the new unit through a very extensive laboratory test to make sure that it wasn't going to have a problem in somewhat of those conditions that we do as a regular fashion. In other words, I think a lot of the people need the building, so they're willing to pay out the 6% or whatever percent they have to for the engineering and the architecture work to be done. The other unusual thing, though, I'm finding is generally, there's someone that -- all I can say is some -- there's always one manufacturer who's doing things that I consider a little foolish as the way they handle their pricing structure. You've been able to push through price, and input prices have been very stable. They were set up to be used on R-22. If you look at fourth quarter of 2012 and say how are we going to relate to that, what we're saying to -- is while we're going to have record sales and we're going to have record profits for 2014, in the fourth quarter we expect that the sales compared to the fourth quarter last year will probably be a little less because as I said, we had a very booming fourth quarter last year and we shipped some of our normal fourth quarter business -- this year, we shipped it in the third quarter. And the new laboratory is going to cost an unknown amount at this time, but it's probably going to be in the $10 million to $15 million arena or somewhere in that vicinity. We might have -- because we still are booking quite well, we might have a chance to lift it up in December a little higher than we would normally have it. And it's the most stable market I've ever experienced in the way of, like, purchase parts and purchase commodities, and that's an unusual thing. Probably the biggest one that we have coming up, and we are not ready for it yet because we have to do our homework, so to speak, to make sure we've studied it out well enough to do it correctly, and that is we need a new laboratory. And I'm wondering if there's – one, is there something more in the pipe to do? There seems to be a persistent theme here where there's a lot of bids, but a lot of -- but a similar number of postponements and a lot of delays on projects. I'm just wondering, have you ever seen a sort of environment like this where you've seen such low input prices, you've been able to push through price and have been able to take market share in such a challenging environment? The rollout of that new coil in the equipment, is that something that's gradually getting phased in over the SKUs? If you look at AHRI statistics on the products shipped by unit size, and the most recent one I have is the August data, it shows it to be down for August compared to 1 year ago. The other thing, of course, which is, is if electrical costs are going up in some area, the older R-22 equipment just across-the-board, no matter whose product it is or whatever, is a more inefficient product than what today's product is. Could you comment on your bid activity and the timing for decisions? To the extent we're able to maintain this performance, it may maintain itself on the high side of 10% because it is driven in part by the component of profit sharing. You've done some capital projects. So to the extent that the company performs better in profit as a percentage of sales, SG&A automatically gets driven up because the profit sharing is a component of SG&A. So if that is down a little bit and the basic construction market is level, I have to assume that downage is due to a weaker replacement market than the new construction because the new construction was constant. And now they've got a third component in there, which is how much is R-22 refrigerant costing. We're about -- in dollars, we're at about the 30% mark as far as the dollars of our shipment that have the new coil. We're not seeing material costs go up. Or any projects is starting to break ground? We're quite optimistic, looking forward, about the future of AAON. So the higher the profit as a percent of sales, the higher that component of SG&A as a percentage of sales. And then just to clarify your commentary on replacement versus construction demand, did you say replacement in the industry, sales were down 4% and construction probably down even more than that?"

Profitability, came about more by the fact that even though there was some volatility in component costs, it went both ways. Over a one-year investigation has been completed on that and the planning has been pretty well completed. And then when we actually got around to shipping that, it had gone the other way, US$1 was only bringing us C $0.90 some cents or a dollar in Canadian. It turned up to be very bad because we had always got low dollar- related orders; then we had to build after the exchange rate has changed on. We have gotten enough going that we're going to expand the Tulsa facility a little bit more because we feel we can improve our facility enough that the efficiency of manufacturing will offset the cost of building the additional facility. With that being completed, I'd like to introduce Kathy Sheffield, our CFO. And some [subsistence] from the whole year from the beginning to the end, inflation was up probably somewhere in 4% to 5% on our cost of material. Kathy Sheffield Good afternoon. I mentioned early on in the discussion that the large tonnage equipment in the US is done very well. So we had a very vicious cycle going on. Basically it's still a question mark about the viability of that operation. It was further pyramided by the fact that we got a lot of orders in the early part of the year, which was good if today's dollar hadn't changed. But they are within manageable means to go forward and the real question in that operation comes down to availability of orders at the price we have to have in the US. Capital expenditures for the year were $10.9 million and related to increased equipment related to increase in production and sales efficiency, some innovations to our Tulsa facility. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated.","Frank Magdlen The Robins Group Can you give us a little more color as to what your backlog looks like at this time? Kathy Sheffield And wisely spent, we spent $20.771 million in total for all the shares we've bought back and the total number of shares were 1,082,736. The net result of what I've just given you is a summary, and then I will break it down, talk a little more, is that we've got more backlog at this time this year than we had in this time in 2006. Kathy Sheffield That's how many shares we have outstanding. They would be glad to give us the order if we will give them the price that they will feel happy with. Jon Braatz Kansas City Capital Obviously, you don't know how well this is going to go, how much volume, how much capacity might you have if this indeed is successful as a marketing effort? That will take care of the bulk of the assembly problem. I guess is it possible that if the Canadian operations were not feasible going forward and the decisions made to move those, could they move into that facility or would you need another facility in the US? Norman Asbjornson And we had, as we've said last year we bought back a little over a million shares for a little over $20 million, and that was all out of cash flow. That becomes a very difficult and not very productive thing to do, to duplicate your engineering department, a portion of it anyway, as well as adding the assembly personnel necessary to run second shift. Number one, how good the order input is, and number two, how well we're able to turn those orders out if the customer is asking the delivery fairly quickly. Kathy Sheffield SG&A increased for a couple of reasons. In our industry of all our competitors, two of our competitors are focused on the replacement market, two other competitors we have are more focused at the new construction and plan replacement market, as we are. Norman Asbjornson Well, that is a very difficult one and a very good question because the residential market is very much a commodity market and it really truly lives on pretty much nothing but price. If you look at the order input, we are at overseeing respectable times. All of the factories right now are quite well, and so we're not gaining backlog because of our inability to bill. Our game plan is to build up a fairly substantial inventory, but we will have it all in our building and ship out of there. What we're doing, I mentioned early on, that we've done some long range planning for the Tulsa facility, and I'll talk about our major capital expenditure. Not because of the quality of the product or performance of the product or anything, but because of our pricing. If you take the past six months we have taken in more orders than we did a year ago, in corresponding six months. Kathy Sheffield Bear with me, just one minute. And then we picked up a whole bunch more, because it was easier to go out and get a national account, get high volume than it was to do getting the one and two unit orders and smaller orders from many more customers. Our efforts in that area are going to be by eliminating one step of distribution and selling directly over the Internet. The difference in the situation is typically in that marketplace they build inventory and distribute the inventory to various distribution houses all over the United States, so they build up a huge amount of inventory in local stocks as well as in their factory stocks. Kathy Sheffield Thank you. And if we can get a few orders, we can handle the orders. And so now, like I said earlier, the question is, can we continue to get enough orders because we have corrected this pricing problem. Norman Asbjornson What we are planning on doing. The place where we are growing the fastest and where we are hurting the most for assembly effort is in our largest, most sophisticated, technically complex product line, things that take a full truckload just to carry one unit away. We do have a small order for about $150,000 from New York City, and we are supposed to ship that within the next 30 days. And the backlog we have right now is in the low 50 millions. That will catch a bulk of the assembly area that we need. I don't know if we can or not; we're not booking at the same rate we're shipping right now. I hope I haven't confused you with that analysis, but we're doing well and still getting orders, better than we did a year ago, we're moving them out of the place better than we did a year ago, but it's much harder to get new orders. Frank Magdlen The Robins Group Yeah, but if you're going forward, if you're looking through… Kathy Sheffield That was at the end of the year. And in that regard, it's very high efficient, much higher than the SEER 13, which is federal mandate and it has several other features we think that are very important to people, one of which is the ability to dehumidify the building when cooling isn't required. How does the marketing process go when you attempt to attack the residential market? Once you get it built, how quickly do you think that ramp could be, as far as getting the equipment in there and the people hired? So, it's not just totally dependent on order input. Increasing capacity on these acreage and the part of that that we are doing now, the 107,000 some that we are going put in will do a portion of that. By this time, we always work off backlog a little bit and our backlog is dependent upon two factors. The first thing we are going to be putting in this new plant is a second identical production line to the one we already have for those big units and by doing that, we will be able to offload enough off from that existing line, as well as second sized down product line, which is the second one I was mentioning that we had made all the technical changes of, which is 26 ton to 70 ton, and we are going to duplicate that production line too, because it is the second most technically complex product we have. Norman Asbjornson Well, as I stated earlier if you take, say, the last six months of new orders; we have done better than we did in the comparable period a year ago. I've told you that we are moving stuff through the billing process very well right now. Could you just give some outlook and break it down in terms of new construction and replacement side, so outlook to what you've seen so far in 2008 and maybe going forward into 2008? We'd have to do something on, but the assembly area per se, that will allow us some major improvement in our ability to assemble and here is problem. How much capacity will that add? We will build inventory. We backed off what we're moving through the present time is more closely related to about $10 million to $12 million because of price increases and the fact that we built out our backlog. We believe we know how to make that work and reduce our cost of distribution by somewhere around 20%. And if you order something, say, right now today it would be our intent that we would have it on the truck tomorrow morning, and maybe if it's early enough in the day, it will go out the same day. Doing a little bit more planning, our present facility is on 13 acres now, and over the past three to four years we've managed to buy 14 acres directly adjacent to our 13 acres thinking that we're probably going to need that to expand if this residential thing gets going. Kathy Sheffield No, basically we are paying that completely out of cash flow. Kathy Sheffield Okay. And because they are technically complicated, if we go to a second shift in our existing product plant, and at the present time we have a very limited second shift, if we do much more than we've got right now, we almost have to duplicate a lot of our engineering department to work the second shift, because enough engineering questions come up during the workday that must be answered, that you must have technical people around in order to answer those questions. And by doing that, without changing personnel at all, we will be able to build a fair amount of more products than we are able to build right now, just by improving the efficiency of our assembly operation. But we did very well, taking orders this year, in the past few months compared to a year ago, we moved them out very well, which is really good. But it's been much harder to get those orders in the past few months than it did a year ago. Number one, we'll be hiring people and training people at the factory level and number two really number one, is to be getting the orders. And we have a product now and I could take an order for just about any size job, if I could get it. We can actually improve our efficiency enough so that we can pay for the building, as well as get ourselves prepared for further growth. But January and February particularly are historically low booking months up there. Could you then go to Canada and just quantify what the revenues were up there if you're willing to and maybe what you lost in operations out there? Just expanding on what you just went over on the Tulsa operation, the new operation there. And we have ourselves set up to be able to handle some percentage growth. Will you build inventory for that business? So we still have some confidence building to do before we are going to get the big orders. Norman Asbjornson Our loss up there was just under 10% of that booking or of that revenue number. We have less backlog, however, than we had a year ago at this time. We have a lot of heavier quality people around now. Norman Asbjornson Well, we still probably are doing about 45% replacement and about 55% new construction, which is one potential problem because if an economic slowdown does occur, it generally hits some new construction much more than it does replacement market. So order input is good. We determined that by adding some more assembly area, so it's just a shell type building, it doesn't have even much in it. I would think that you'd almost have to as opposed to build the order. Kathy Sheffield Primarily, the currency trend. So, the question of our ability to get bookings is going to get resolved in the next few months, when they usually start bookings months. Kathy Sheffield We'll be back in the market buying by Friday of this week. The other one, which is one of the next steps we're going to have to go through, is the warehousing of material and straightening out our warehousing to handle that kind of volume. Kathy Sheffield We appreciate your attendance and we'll talk to you in May."

Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good afternoon. But next year being 2012, we expect to have a fairly sizable increase in our parts business due to putting this warehouse in place. The backlog is also indicative of upturn. In addition to which the efficiency in the whole operation will improve, and I'm sure we've got a loss factor that will be lessened once we get everything in the warehouse. We have at the present time a little over 200,000 square feet of additional building under construction. Capital expenditures were $17.5 million for manufacturing and equipment purchases and costs to expand our manufacturing facility at the Tulsa location. And between the specifying and the time that we actually ship equipment is somewhere around six months usually. Did not disrupt our order flow very much. We don't, however, expect that to happen very suddenly because most of the people we were showing it to are the consulting engineers, who if they felt good about it and went back, they specify this on buildings yet to be built. Our effective tax rate decreased from 37% to 33% due to an increase in the domestic production activity tax credit from 6% to 9%, higher R&D credits than we anticipated and other domestic credits. But that again will not find its way to our bottom line until the very end of the second quarter or possibly the third quarter, since we have to work through all the backlog before we get to that price increase. We do anticipate the continuation of commodity costs increases. Our gross profit percentage has decreased due to the absence of a derivative that we benefited from in 2009, cost increases led by commodity prices and our inability to implement price increases given the economic environment that we are in. That's really the driving force because a lot of our components that we buy from vendors are made of those materials and so the vendor prices for components has also increased. The incoming order rates, while it's been quite good so far, we anticipate it could definitely be impacted by a product show, which we held on January 31 in Las Vegas in conjunction with our industry-wide HRAI [ph] show. And that is variable by various components in the units, so I can't tell you it's a flat number because it is not. In the end of 2010, our backlog was $38,370,000 compared to a year, I mean, excuse me, that was compared to a year ago where it was, just a minute, compared to a year ago of $32,150,302. I'd like now to introduce our Vice President and CFO, Kathy Sheffield, who will give you the numbers. In addition to the reason we mentioned in the quarterly discussion, gross profit was affected by onetime costs associated with relocation of production lines and also the addition of production facilities. The United States no longer is a big factor in a lot of the commodities. And as such, the world's doing better in the recovery than the United States, and so the commodity prices have already been going up and I expect them to continue going up. We have been fortunate in the past three years to have been able to improve productivity consistently. All of our materials have increased over the past year by a fairly large percentages. That building is primarily for warehouse facility, which we've been in bad need of for several years. We took about $1,500,000 worth of equipment out to the show. If that comes into being, it should happen relatively soon and perhaps is already beginning to happen as is reflected by our increase in new orders compared to a year ago. The one salvation in that, of course, is the fact that approximately half of our business or a little bit more now comes from replacement market and the replacement has moderated that downturn in new construction. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated.","We try to do it very efficiently but we didn't try and keep track of the particular costs associated with it. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO I think the new construction still kind of skating along the bottom. And so there was a learning curve for all of our assemblers on that. The first of the month, the backlog was $37,977,841. Are you still sort of at the bottom or where would you put yourself in that sort of cycle that you're witnessing? Because in order to effect that you have to have the product installed and operational before the end of the year. So what we've shipped this quarter, we've shipped $400,000 more than what we've taken in orders. So it makes the cash flow situation much more impressive. Could you talk about the dynamic between implementing the price increases and what you're seeing in the rising raw material costs? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Joe Mondillo with Sidoti & Co. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC Norm, I was wondering if you could speak about -- you talked about input cost rising. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC And then you talked about backlog, I was wondering if you have the backlog today? So it improves the efficiency there plus the fact that it has no rubbing of metal to metal on bearings, improves the efficiency of the motor and the compressor, and it's got all the electronic things that they could dream up in the compressor to make it even more efficient, and that result is a very highly efficient compressor. First of all, is the fact that going into the new product and into the new facility and then putting in new production lines, trying to figure that out is very difficult because you've got so many things happening there. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Well, right now of course, with what backlog we have and what we will pick up between now and the end of March, it will all be a full price. You have one less heat exchange surface, going from hot gas to water and water to air, you go directly from hot gas to air in the heat exchange surfaces, and that eliminates one efficiency loser. And then in terms of your replacement sales versus new construction, I guess, where would you say you are in the new construction cycle? And coupling it to the evap condenser, effectively takes the place of what is normally done in the chiller industry of putting a chiller and putting condenser water pumps and putting a cooling tower, and then tying them all together in the field with piping and everything to put those three items in conjunction with each other, in order to get an operating system. What is further really interesting in this, I talked about the efficiency of what we've got. So we've got a highly efficient machine, it's very cost competitive and the biggest problem we've got is marketing it, going out and telling people about it. But what really sets it apart is the fact that in addition to -- first, cost, being very good, probably very comparable or lower than when putting the other ones together, the efficiency is decidedly is the highest in the marketplace because of two factors. Does not require oil. And so when you get rid of the oil, that improves the efficiencies of all your heat exchangers surfaces in the unit. If the commodity cost are not going to go up appreciably, and I don't believe they are, I'm thinking it might moderately go up but it's going to be pretty small, I think, at this point."

And that resulted -- we were up 19% in orders compared to 2010 through August and then we started going behind. And so when the government allowed us to take 100% depreciation, we did some calculations and concluded it was very optimal for us to take advantage of that even though the machines that we were going to obsolete weren't totally worn out although they were very, very badly worn because they had between 60-some thousand working hours and almost 100,000 working hours give you a point of that reference, one year has 8,760 hours in it. That is a very real and probable thing because there is more optimism in the society right now and so that's highly likely that there was some of that. The net result is that going into this year, we were not booking business well because the replacement market was just kind of dead for the last 5 months. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good afternoon, and welcome to our conference call. In addition to the quarter details, year- to-date margins were also impacted by the loss of production for 8.5 days in February and production inefficiencies throughout October due to the building damage caused by the snowstorm and also by increases in raw material and component parts throughout the year. That will add to our productivity of our operation when we finally get there. The market being stable then, the question comes about well, what can you really expect if that's the true case what can you expect based upon your historicals and project it forward? And I've already told you what's happening to our order input. In addition to the previous discussion, operating income was impacted by a $1.8 million loss on the trade-in of equipment. That's where everything in our world starts is our equipment. And so we had basically 50% of our sheet metal equipment to be changed out in the fourth quarter and trying not losing any production time. So of that $55.3 million that was in here on March 1, probably about 90% of it was pre-price increase because the price increase occurred in the February time frame and the orders that came in after the price increase is probably about 10% of that backlog. So it will have a material effect in that sense. So that gave us a problem of products that we could ship, build and ship in fourth quarter of last year, as well as all of our other problems which compounded, including the fact that the equipment, the majority of the equipment we ordered from our sheet metal machinery dealer, all of it aligned in the fourth quarter. And then the new orders really started kicking in and they really came in. But we went well below freezing on the west building, which caused equipment damage, plumbing damage, you name it, we had it damaged, and we had no ability to heat the building. Let us talk about the equipment, first of all. In the first 7 months of last year, we booked orders at a rate 19% better than what we had the previous year. But the other thing which we do badly need is the warehouse. As I said and as continuing, there was one thing that you have to recognize, that has to be realized, is we had another couple of price increases during that time frame and with those price increases, you'll always get an influx of orders so that they beat the price increase. I wouldn't tell you the total percentage bookings because it's unreal and I'd lose credibility with you. So we've got a lot of things going that could explain that input of business. Due to the magnitude of the input of the orders that we have received in the first 2 months of this year and are continuing to receive, I would give credit to all 3 scenarios, but I would give the dominance of credit to the new products' reception in the marketplace. So if that is the dominant thing, it's reasonable to expect a continuation of that order input. And we're in the process now of working on the final 30%, most of which will be concluded this year. So we will see as we go forward whether the third option is the one that really is the real word for why we are doing so well on the bookings. From 2003 to 2008, in those buildings that I mentioned, those various building types, the growth in dollars spent according to the U.S. government was construction spending over those period between 2003 and 2008 in those building types went up 64%. And that result is we're very optimistic around here that it may not be as wonderful a situation going forward, but we're still quite optimistic that it's going to be a very good situation considering the marketplace. We got a trade-in price from the vendor of the new equipment and then we ordered that new equipment with the option to trade in the old equipment with no commitment made at the time we ordered the new machinery. So I can only assume that it somewhat tracks new construction. I would like introduce Kathy Sheffield, our CFO. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control, that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. So even with a flat sequence in the building of those buildings, which is what we anticipate, we still will expect that, that growth of market share taking that we're experiencing for the past 3 years is going to continue, which is about the difference between a 37% decline on the construction side and AAON's 5% decline or a 32% difference over a 3-year time frame there. As we told you in the past, we pre-bought a lot of things to try and offset cost increases on them and we pretty well used them all up during the year so that our inventory was pretty well back. And the bookings we were having, we concluded were primarily due to government's 100% depreciation on certain capital goods and the people who were ordering it like we did our machinery early in the year and as the year went on, they ordered less and less and it diminished until end of fourth quarter they weren't ordering any of it and we were pretty well running out of it, the orders that we had. Now that market is the lodging building type buildings, office buildings, commercial buildings, health care buildings, educational buildings, religious buildings and manufacturing projects and then another all- inclusive group called other types of buildings. So there was a 14% differential in the growth, which was -- had nothing else really be material there other than we took up much market share. The decrease in revenues can be contributed to 10 less production days due to plant shutdowns associated with the holidays and to a decline in orders from customers who were not able to receive their orders before the year end to take advantage of that Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act for equipment that was put into service in 2011. I spoke a little bit earlier about the architect's billing index and I'm sitting looking at one of their indexes right now and as I look at it that and I go back say to 2010 and look forward through the entire year of 2011, and try and project that into the next 12 months of orders or the balance of 2012 and what I'm seeing there is that it's sort of a stable situation as far as how many hours were billed for by the architects in designing buildings, which is probably the best index I know of in the building industry to say what's going to happen in the commercial building market. We have had this phenomenal order input and so the question arises, why did you have a phenomenal order input? But the one part that really took a real beating was the bottom line because we had all these extraneous costs that we haven't anticipated and really money at which we had no control over which beat up on us on the financial side. In addition to the lower productivity that we just discussed, the gross margin for the quarter was also affected by several other factors: Inefficient sheet metal production due to changing out of approximately 50% of our capacity in a short period of time in order to have our new equipment that we installed in the fourth quarter operable by the end of the year, numerous costs expensed during the change out of the equipment, inefficiencies in production due to lack of sheet metal parts in a timely fashion, costs associated with relocating 3 assembly lines and rearranging 2 other assembly lines, a continuation of component part price increases that we were any unable to fully pass on to our customers, and manufacturing inefficiencies due to the introduction of new products. The nice thing of it is of course, that throughout this -- excuse me for having this kind of a raspy throat here -- throughout this time frame, we've been able to keep our inventory under control for the year in total. And when we got back up, we had no temperature control in the west building.","And sort of what -- if you could, is there a at capacity utilization number that you're on, you're at in terms of that new machinery? Jonathan Paul Braatz Kansas City Capital Associates In 2011, last year, you spent about $36 million in new equipment, so on, so forth. DeForest Hinman With the increase in backlog, have you had to hire additional workers? Now flipping to the most recent one, which I have the census data on through January of this year and looking down through it and looking at January of 2011 versus January of 2012, manufacturing is up 38.3%, which is phenomenal. We are not at the present time hiring because we think the increased productivity which we've accomplished by rearranging all those production lines and buying that machinery probably we'll be able to stay with about that much personnel and be reasonably able to do the same volumes we did last year. In our manufacturing business, that normally has been about 14% of our marketplace. So we have already planned out the buildings and we've already done all the internal work as far as figuring out what kind of volume we can get out of it, what we're going to have to do, how many fork lifts, how many everything down to very minute details we do in this planning. And so when we get to the point that we think we can make money by improving the efficiency and adequately, we will go ahead and build some more of that building. Do you have a stronger market share on the manufacturing segment as opposed to other market segments? Are you operating at 50% capacity, 60%? And we will proceed on building some things not because we need more buildings, because we're overutilized or underutilized or anything it's because the efficiency can be enhanced in our manufacturing methods. Now, obviously, there was going to be a nice payback on that equipment, productivity, other cost savings and so on and so forth. And consequently, even though at the present time, in order to complete the building process that we have already planned, we always do our planning several years in advance because initial planning is never very good, and as we get a little older and a little smarter, we keep changing the plan. On the building side of it, we can afford the building for the improved monthly productivity. And the primary reason for that is that the machinery have been improved that much by the manufacturer and it's almost twice as fast as the old machinery that we would have replaced, not counting the downtime. And are there any worries there in terms of efficiencies taking on the extra workers or do you think you can get them trained up to speed relatively quickly? One is just a small extension on the east facility and the other one is a new laboratory that we need here. Most of Longview's business comes up there in the form of material to get put into our product. So yes, there is a very big upswing in manufacturing buildings, by far the biggest upswing many times more than anything else. At this point in time, if the order input is at all anything close to resembling what we're doing out in the world and that's highly debatable. That is in 2 building processes. And that occurred at about the second week of January, at which point in time, it became obvious to me by the order input that I'd better stop it. It sounds as if that one particular area of the, let's say, nonresidential construction market, that has been strong and sort of new manufacturing facilities."

But on March 1, our backlog this year was $51.1 million compared to $55.3 million, March 1, 2012. At December 31, 2011, the company had $3.8 million of capital expenditures and accounts payable that are included in the cash outflows of $14.1 million for 2012. So we have that $3.5 million, that I spoke of, that we've lost in orders so far in the first 2 months, is showing up directly in the backlog. Also, the fourth quarter of 2011 included nonrecurring charges such as inefficient sheet metal production due to the changing out of approximately 50% of our capacity in a short period of time, in order to have our new equipment operable by the end of the year. And the outlook for 2013, at present, we said our backlog was -- roughly comparable at the end of 2012 to the end of 2011. In 2011, the company had a loss of $1.8 million on the trade in of old equipment. Our replacement market, versus new construction, continued to be this dominant force. For the year 2012, the incoming order rate or incoming business for the first 2 months of the year of last year compared to the first 2 months of this year, as I noted, had an incoming order rate 3.5% less. Incoming order rate, that has occurred so far in 2013 compared to 2012, is down approximately $3.5 million from a year ago. The improvement in gross profit can be attributed to changes in commodity costs, increased product prices, improved product mix and productivity. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control, that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Numerous costs expensed during the change out of the equipment, inefficiencies in production due to lack of sheet metal parts in a timely fashion and costs associated with relocating 3 assembly lines and rearranging 2 other assembly lines. So although we have experienced a little bit of slackness in the incoming orders in the first 2 months of the year, it's anticipated this is picking up and will, for the year as a whole, give us an up -- a slight upswing.","And then from then on, we still have the backlog which will be, probably couple months, where the backlog in May and June are still going to be on the old pricing. And so we're going on with a price increase which will, of course, give us a bottom line increase because this will take 30 days before we start getting the new orders in so that will push it out to the end of April. So it will be a little hard for another month or 2 to really say that we've got an either up or down heading in our orders. We really -- basically, at this point in time, we're out there doing things that are improving productivity. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO We're in the process of talking about what the proper way to distribute the cash is. So it says that the people will have a need for a building and they're asking architects and engineers to design the building. We're modestly optimistic, I guess, we'd say. Here's the 2 things that I see happening: one, if the people who are spending their money to design these new buildings go ahead and start giving contracts out on them, new construction is going to get going quite well and give us a distinct growth in the new construction market as opposed to the past year. The business, we've been doing well at getting orders and it's just that we're now much more on top of our orders and shipping as soon as people will accept shipments. Just wondering sort of there's anything in particular other than sort of just the general feel that the economy is getting better that makes you think that given that your backlog and orders have been sort of weak in the first 2 months of the year? It's no longer ""I have to have, ""I have to spend"", it's should we spend and get the long-term benefit from improved productivity either by building improvement, building a slightly additional building or 2, or else, buying machinery. We're trying to be a little bit anticipatory and get a backlog that reflects what we think we're going to pay for stuff down the road. The cost of repairing and replacing that refrigerant and the possibility of having it again, they don't really much care whether the units were worn out or not, they're going to replace it which may be a trend that's coming because the cost of putting R-22 in is getting quite expensive and people are getting a little skittish about keeping that type of equipment on their roof or in their buildings anymore. As you know, other than what we think we have a need for, for whatever reason, we try and find the best method to distribute cash to the stockholders, and that's still our policy. Jonathan Paul Braatz Kansas City Capital Associates The price increases you talked about, 3% to 4%, are they reflective of some of the costs -- some cost pressures you're seeing in steel and component parts or -- and so on? Because while we've had a weak 2 months in bookings, we're going to distort it a little bit this month because we are having a price increase. The one thing that is occurring, and it's going to occur more and more as we go forward, is R-22, which was the refrigerant of choice for years and years, is being priced through tax incentives and arbitrary demands by the federal government, that the people who manufacture it can only manufacture so much and it's less every year, and considerably less this year. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Well one of the things which happened in the fourth quarter last year is because of all of our improvements in our manufacturing capabilities, we were able to ship everything anybody decided to take. Joseph Logan Mondillo Sidoti & Company, LLC So it seems like you're going to be generating a lot of cash -- a lot more cash this year, just given the earnings improvement and CapEx sort of coming down the -- from the past couple of years."

Net earnings for the quarter were 24.8 million or $0.46 per share compared to $0.48 last year when we absoluted the parking debt fill we had in the first quarter of 2007. Our business in April is ahead of last year and we are optimistic for our growth this quarter with the tax rebates beginning in May. As Ken mentioned, we awarded area development agreement to open another 50 franchise stores during the quarter and our pipeline of stores to open at the end of March with 300 stores. Also merged and closed, 20 Company operated and pre-franchise stores during the quarter. We are happy; we are ahead of last year as far as production and profitability in those plants.

We opened 14 new Company operated stores, 8 new franchise stores, 2 Company operated Renco Stores and 2 franchise Renco Stores. Including without limitation the Company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings for future periods. We run a break even but the process is kind of relative, but we are ahead or we were. All in all, it is kind of flattish, but again manufacture is positive and rent to rent still continues to be profitable. Our franchise systems continue to move forward as we awarded 15 new stores fronts to the quarter bringing our pipeline at the 300 new franchise stores to open in the future. At March 30, we had 983 Company operated sales and lease ownership stores open, 483 franchise stores, 29 Company operated Renco stores, 6 franchise Renco stores and 62 corporate furniture stores open for a total 1,563 stores. We did record a $2.3 million gain in the quarter from the sale of the Company operated stores to the franchisees; however we did have some lease obligations. We are doing a lot of advertising and moving a lot of products through our furniture manufacturing.","John Baugh Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. You had eight franchise stores open and I guess the target is still in the 70 (inaudible) and you don’t control the franchisees per se, what is your conviction level that we hit that 70 for the year? That will improve cash flow this year, too. The deferral on the balance sheet is where the free cash flow factor will come in and that deferred taxes will go up this year as we recognize income that we deferred paying it, which is a liability to the Government. That should be around $50 million of free cash flow this year in ’08 that we won’t have to pass on to the Government. As I noted in the earnings release, we generated over 30 million free cash flow from operations in the first quarter. It will certainly help from a cash flow standpoint. Which tax is on the income statement versus cash flow statement? Certainly, a lot of that is just due to our stores and supply costs and certainly, it has been looked at very carefully over the last several years and we are getting some good product purchasing power from our vendors and that is slowly kind of working its way through the system. Gil Danielson I think we will hit the 70; as you say, we don’t control the push a lot and prod a lot but we feel confident we will hit that number. It could get close to 150 million from operations. That will continue and if you throw in this IRS holiday here, our cash flows from operations will certainly be more than 100 million this year."

A well-known CEO from a major retail chain once said, ""It's all about the stores, dummy!"" Our focus on the acquisition and maintenance of our existing customer base and new customers has continued to take huge dividend.

Typically, in the past 20 years, everybody's done -- our transaction is very similar or very -- almost identical margins, low weekly rates and here we come along and we've done it quite different with larger stores or prices, the monthly payment program, distribution center, we've gone national. I think that last January, we typically rented this, for example, sofa love seat for 12 months and then we would do a package power and stretch the term out to 18 months by including cocktail tables and tables and lamps.

Our stores, DCs and home office support will be following this project as well. We have a lot of folks and associates that are working daily for consolidating stores, moving inventory around and selling inventories to achieve this goal over the next six to 12 months. But if you did that, our revenues would've been up 6% and net earnings from continuing operations, up 15% in the first quarter of '10 compared to the first quarter of 2009. The store count at March 31, we had 1,080 company stores, 595 franchised stores, 11 company-operated RIMCO stores, seven franchised RIMCO stores and 12 Office Furniture stores, for a total of 1,705 stores. They're also being much more efficient material products to stop all the waste. We did use approximately $26 million in cash flow from operations in the first quarter. It all started by maximizing material waste and yield and expanded with recycling paper, cardboard, soda plastics and aluminum. At the end of the first quarter, we had 840,000 company-operated store customers and 453,000 franchised customers. We expect to continue our new store expansion with approximately 90 new company-operated stores and 75 new franchised stores for 2010. The Aaron's Office Furniture division, basically 10 stores left in that division continues to struggle, and we have a plan in place and are working very hard making changes, closing a few stores, consolidate, selling some inventory, for both revenue growth and overall financial performance will improve. Our factories were the first to jump on board and, literally, have eliminated millions of tons of waste from going to landfills. Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter for the Aaron's company-operated stores was 4.4%, and it was 2.9% for stores over two years old. Our RIMCO model was profitable for the quarter and in fact, operated in the black all three consecutive months. The first quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and actually total diluted earnings per share were $0.45 compared to $0.43 last year. As noted in our earnings release, Aaron's has a very predictable and has annuity-type business that has performed well over a number of years through different economic cycles. Our stores are looking in at what they can do to eliminate more paperwork in their operations, and they have already initiated some programs that conservatively will save 125 trees a month.","And we don't analyze it every day or very definitively on the component makeup of it. One other question, Ken, your comments about the logistic changes at the DCs. You'd go heading back with nothing on the truck, then that's not very efficient at all. The recycling is pretty simple. When you talk about the cash flow from operations being used of $26 million, it looks like inventory was something that grew pretty markedly in the quarter. And the remaining nine months, this is based on our projected taxable income, we expect we'll make another $85 million. And with all this related scale, the larger we get, the better buying power we have in just about any vendor we have to leverage business, more revenue we generate in the stores and lever off the operating expenses. The product is needed to fuel that annuity stream. It goes and it may not be the oil industry, but there's a lot of industries that follow. So given your revenue guidance, we would expect about high single-digit type of increase in the inventory. You can recycle your image in, what, pretty much every five years, what we're looking at. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President But now, again, it's the same old product mix that we've been dealing with through all these years... William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Same great product mix that we've been... Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President New product mix... William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Same high-quality, great product mix, we meant. But that's about how we really kind of project, Arvind. So the first kind of six months, which started first of the year, we're kind of cleaning up and closed down a couple stores, Memphis, Raleigh, a couple of markets that we thought just weren't efficient. But for the last, two, three, four number of years, Texas was the... William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director And what I hear about Texas, it's just flat because of the oil production. Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Right, as far as recycling. We are putting in a larger TV that we finally got into our warehouse. I think we bought a $40,000 cheaper haul-off machines that grinds up the waste, but that was more than offset by the dump truck fees mistake, by not all entertaining the dump. Our factory, I don't think really invested in anything other than just how efficient it is. And so it left us with a lot of inventory, and some real estate and some other opportunities, as I call them. One last question, we talked a little bit about the inventory being up on a six-month basis. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director I don't think we've had any material change. But whatever your revenue projection is for the year, I think the purchases over that time period would pretty well attract those revenue increases. We don't even project comps. So we really initiated a program over the last year and a half that we're contracting with other carriers and companies to do back-calling."

Our backlog of stores, of franchise stores to open over the next few years, was at 271 at the end of March. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings, as well as store acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. The company had 914,000 company- operated store customers and 499,000 franchise customers at the end of the quarter. For the first quarter of 2011, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 10 new company- operated stores, 9 new franchise stores, 1 RIMCO store and 2 HomeSmart stores. At the end of March, we had 1,140 company Sales & Lease stores, 666 franchise stores, 11 company-operated RIMCO stores 6 franchised RIMCO stores. Again in 2011, we expect to add approximately 90 new company- operated stores and 75 franchise stores at this time. There is no 1 initiative that will spike earnings overnight, but it's a continuing process that should continue to improve margins over the upcoming periods. We did generate during the quarter, a little over $140 million in cash flow from operations, about $100 million of that came from getting a refund from the IRS of the tax refund. I echo your remarks on Woodhaven because they just won the award here in Atlanta for their going green initiative and they've done an unbelievable job in recycling materials in their plant.","So maybe, you'll only agree at $0.50 so far, but we're optimistic we can address it. So there's just customers that have been to Aaron's and customers that have been to Rent-a-Center, and certainly other rental places that for whatever reason won't go back, and they're idle in the market. But it's amazing how well our people rebounded and really literally shoveled their way in to get to work the everyday just to keep the lights on and not give our customers an excuse not to pay. 1 is on the fuel cost side, are you able to pass on right now any of the higher cost on sort of the input cost of fuel? And certainly, our inventory costs are going to be less because our prices are somewhat higher. Matthew Schon McCall BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division Then one more question, the other benefit of your scale is the cash you're going to generate, I think you've said in the past, growth rate sub 10% will generate some cash. And then I think the prior question on the performance during the quarter, I don't know if you've seen it, but your competitor is saying that February was a tough month and March rebounded. You got to scale up for the next 1,000 Aaron's stores, the next -- if we get the HomeSmart rolling, you got to be scalable there and get the efficiencies. It is a process we're constantly working on it, we're a very cost conscious cautious company. But just as we know that we've got some opportunity, just because of now, our scale and our size that we just got folks really reevaluating our processes. That being said, I don't think there'll be a big difference in labor and the other typical operating expenses. But our shipments -- I mean the DCs were even paralyzed, we weren't shipping for a number of days. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Yes, our fuel cost went up $1.2 million this quarter compared to last year's quarter. So consequently, our traffic in our store is good and they've chosen to go that route and I applaud them for it, and hopefully, they'll do great at it. We talked a lot in the past about some of the initiatives that are going on in the corporate level to look at our efficiencies and processes. Of course, we're fighting price increases coming from manufacturers, and we may start seeing a little inflation. Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Yes, I mean we're looking at payroll processes, we're looking at IT processes, we're looking at just efficiencies that we can gain just from a technology, maybe outsourcing some stuff. I think it's too soon to give you the results to say this is an absolute no-brainer, but I think we're definitely on the right path. So we're very, very, very optimistic about April."

As noted in the earnings release, during the first quarter, we did take into income $35.5 million or $0.28 per diluted share in accrual reversal of the lawsuit charges that we set up in the second quarter of 2011. Our management team has been spending more time recently on business planning and the rethinking of some of our support functions and exploring ways to do various tasks a little better which, over the long term, will result in improved efficiencies and increase profitability for the company. During the first quarter of 2012, the company opened 9 company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 6 franchised stores and 2 HomeSmart stores. And during the quarter, 3 company-operated stores were closed. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors, such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, litigation, customer pricing, information security, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings and store acquisitions, as well as disposition activity for future periods. At the end of the quarter, March 31, we had 1,153 company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 710 Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchised stores, 74 HomeSmart stores, 16 company-operated RIMCO stores and 6 franchise RIMCO stores. The customer count on a same- store basis per company-operated stores was up 8.6% in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year. It's a pleasure to discuss the first quarter results of our operations. Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter for our company-operated stores was 4.8%, and it was 2.6% for stores over 2 years old. And for the most part, it will be a little be -- probably a little bit more company-operated than franchised stores, but for the most part, equal amount of stores, and again, as I mentioned, including a handful of the HomeSmart stores. The company had just a little bit more than 1 million company-operated store customers and 554,000 franchised customers at the end of the quarter.","But we are generating some cash more so than we've had in the past. We had tough winter last year that created some downtime. But everything we do here, we're always very aware that there's always room for margin improvement and everything we do and increased efficiency, and we're always working on that. Obviously, we generate some cash in the first quarter. Do you have -- not that you'd want to be there every quarter, but do you have a kind of optimal debt-to-equity number in mind that when you talked about 20% to 25%, is that where you kind of want to get to longer term? Always, using it in a very small way, no individual project by itself really amounts to a huge initiative. So I think this year, we had a pretty clean weather pattern at the whole quarter and I think you saw what we're capable of doing. In fact, I guess we're probably working on the best overall metrics around the country that we've ever operated in. And anytime you have more turnover than you should, that increases your overhead cost for sure. I think we've been alluding to that over the last 3 or 4 quarters, so hopefully, we're doing a little bit better job of executing in the field. But we're very optimistic in some of these things that we're doing over the long-term and the long-term or the next several years or so will certainly help margin expansion. Thomas J. McConville Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Ron, Ken, Gil, Charlie, It's TJ McConville filling in for Budd. The models that we looked at just weren't generating the profit overall that we're generating. If you go back a number of years, I think we went back 20-some-odd years and it really hasn't changed where we get efficient. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Yes, I think first of all, I am proud of the franchisees rebounding the way they did. So I think we're holding path with it because the job -- the good job everybody's doing out there in the field. First one for Gil, the free cash flow this year, Gil, do you have an estimate what you expect for the full year?"

We had actually anticipated in our planning that HomeSmart would have lost around $1 million in the quarter, but it did certainly much better. At March 31, the end of this quarter, we had 1,230 company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 748 Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchised stores, 78 HomeSmart stores, 1 franchised HomeSmart store and the 20 company RIMCO stores and 6 franchised RIMCO stores. The customer count, on a same-store basis for company- operated stores, was up 4.1% in the first quarter compared to the quarter last year. Aaron's has had dramatic growth over the years, providing our customers with high-quality, basic home furnishings, on payment terms, that they can't afford and many times could not obtain at other retailers. We currently have 78 company-operated stores and 1 franchised store open. Just from a store activity, during the quarter, we opened 4 company-operated Aaron's stores. Our new store growth plan for 2013 remains unchanged, and we still expect to add stores, new stores in the range of 4% to 6% increase over the store count we had at the end of 2012, for the most part, an equal mix between the company-operated and franchised stores. I operated #16 for a couple of years before moving up into multi-store management.

We did generate almost $104 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, and we continue, as we kind of say every quarter, that we continue to have positive same-store revenue growth in some of the highest employment areas in the country and just about every state. Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter for company-operated stores was 3.4%, and it was 1.8% up for stores that are over 2 years old.","So it's -- as a franchisee, you know that's a great advantage, versus if he just had to buy it from a normal vendor or through a normal distribution channel. We are unique in our rental business that we have our own distribution centers, and we've talked a lot about that. But I was at our manufacturing facility 2 weeks ago, and our leader down there, Mike Jarnagin, and he was explaining -- he's doing some direct shipments now to franchisees to fill some of the immediate demands, and that's one of the beauties of our system. As Gil said, we can respond to their needs pretty quickly and these were some new products that we had in the furniture line that [indiscernible] at our National Manager Meeting and had a need and demand for them, so Mike was shipping several truckloads to the several franchisees direct. One thing we do, even with our weekly customers, we want to work with them, we want them to keep their product, and Aaron's has set up a relationship business with our customers and we want to use that same approach with our weekly customers even though there are many different type customers out there with weekly needs. What happened that led to such an over-buying by the franchisees in the fourth quarter that they already have full inventory and don't need to buy more right now? And they're very optimistic about the future prospects of it. We're in good shape as far as inventory. And perhaps, there is some effect, but it hasn't really been an item of concern from the field. I mean, can you tell how much inventory they're getting cleared out of the system and will this eventually, maybe in the back half, mean they'll have to ramp orders back up? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, I mean, [indiscernible] a little bit, but we constantly talk to our field people and they cannot see that having a direct effect on our business. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Historically, on our distribution centers, we have maybe $150 million of product at any given point in time. Our stores are spread out somewhat now, so we may fill in some of the volumes between current stores and the like. Did the franchisees get overloaded with televisions or furniture? They know they can get their merchandise whenever they want it, so they get a little bit hesitant to order in advance. Thomas J. McConville Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division It's TJ McConville filling in for Budd. PerfectHome, we've had a great change in sharing information and operations and other things. But that has been an issue on our distribution centers, we're full at the end of March. New -- we're shipping new merchandise, but there's also merchandise that comes back and the franchisees manage their inventory a little tighter than we do and I think that's one thing. But they do have -- and their inventory levels are high now. But it -- again, our product, we can control it going out, both to our company stores and franchised stores, again, a lot of it is furniture. And so yes, business is off a little bit, and our inventory is up about $90 million from a year ago. We got $220 million in our distribution centers now. There's no waiting period for it, they can order pretty much today and they'll get it tomorrow. But I'm curious, the one part of the economy is good, is construction of homes again. Actually, John Trainor from -- in IT will be out in 1 franchised store -- which is a top producer for us in HomeSmart, next Monday, finishing that installation. Ronald W. Allen Former Chief Executive Officer and Director It generated about 12,000 new agreements in -- from new customers, which is encouraging. So hopefully, they will start clearing out their inventory and going forward. Charles Ruff Your lease merchandise inventory is up a little over $100 million from where it was a year ago. And it's still evolving somewhat, but they're doing a lot of work to standardize it. I'm curious whether you can see labor in any particular store or market area that's housing construction-sensitive, where you're starting to see maybe a pickup of business? Ronald W. Allen Former Chief Executive Officer and Director Well, a lot of it's in the -- in -- certainly, in our distribution centers. Gil, you talked about what was baked into the guidance from the non-retail sales part of the business, can you give us some insight on maybe what you're planning for the royalties and fees number? And then, just in terms of the -- a bit of weakness you have been seeing in customer activity, could you comment on why it's not because of Rent-a-Center's rack acceptance business in stores that compete against your stores in terms of product that have a better range of product, with the rack offering being relatively similar in pricing to yours? So the great advantage we have, we have our own manufacturing plants. Laura Allyson Champine Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division It looks like their new customer count is not down nearly as much as their orders are down."

As mentioned in the press release in the second quarter, we had a $3.4 million gain from the sale of some stores to company’s operated to franchisees to a third party operator. Aaron Direct corporate furnishing divisions continue to reposition itself in this tough corporate climate and MacTavish upholstery manufacturing shows an approximately 12% increase for the second quarter and for the same period last year, six month, a 4% increase and we see that continuing as we go into our traditionally busy season in the fall. As our press release said, we are now back for this year, for 2008 to open approximately 55 to 65 new company-operated stores and also for the same amount, 55 to 65 new franchised stores. Including without limitation the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings for future periods. Revenues of franchisees are not however revenues of Aaron Rents Inc. As Ken mentioned, same store revenue growth in the quarter was strong for the company operated stores that was 4.1% for the stores that were opened over two years, company operated stores the revenue growth, same store revenue growth with 1.5% and again as Ken mentioned the same store revenue growth for the franchise stores with 16.1%. At June 30, we had 993 company operated sales and lease ownerships stores, 480 franchise stores, 30 company operated RIMCO stores, seven franchised RIMCO stores and 60 corporate furnishings stores open for a total of 1,570 stores. We do anticipate in ’09 that our square footage growth for ’09, overall combination of company-operated and franchise stores will be in the range of 10% to 13%. Our associates across the board in all divisions both in the field and the corporate offices have worked extremely hard especially in the past two quarters to achieve this record results. Our franchisees continue to shine with 16% same store sales during the quarter and we awarded an additional 29 store territories during the quarter bringing our pipeline to 285 stores to open in the near future. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company, as such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demands and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under risk factors in the company's 2007 annual report on form 10K.","We have done a better job in the field collecting and that is exactly what has happened. I mean I still think we will certainly have that tax breaks are coming in; we will generate probably $40 million or $50 million of cash flow positive this year that we will not to have to pay Uncle Sam. Florida has been one of our strength that still haven’t rebounded and we still have negative store comps. Gil Danielson Rob, right, we do sell stores in most cases as we generated gains on the store sale and that is not really part of normal operations but when we sell the store and it becomes franchise stores it is not like we are walking away and leaving it. We have franchise stores that continues and generate the royalty stream for us that is nearly 6% so it gives us generated gains specially at the stores that are around for a while but it does consist many cases where stores are not performing that well in that royalty stream kind of legs up for whatever we were making in that company store. So how do you see cash load excluding in the sale/lease back for account ‘08? Within the franchise units have you have a better comp and my recollection was they didn’t fly in the collections problems that you had so I mean, if your customers holding up really well which is somewhat surprising unless there is some kind of offset like the credit card that is driving people in or something else. Ken Butler I do think that we are actually looking at our customer base and most of them have been working in the same community and they certainly are in the crunch with gas prices like everyone else but there is a large percent that have cars that the travel transportation services is the big group. John Baugh Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. And then question for anybody who wants to fill it, as we look out to ’09 and in align of the year with maybe 1600 total stores or something like that and then you said minimally 10% growth maybe more so you are looking at I know a 170 to 200 stores obviously some of those franchise but what are you going to do definitely? The Maine is a classic example we never intended to be in Maine and do not have a VP of operations even close to it and if we franchise us stores that they come back and will continue to look at areas like that just like a pocket here and a pocket there and we got to look at the performance of the stores. As far as the stores in the Comp base, company-operated stores are about a thousand stores is 771 stores were in the company.. Arvind Bhatia Sterne, Agee & Leach Okay and is there a way to quantify what kind of benefit you might have received this quarter from stimulus checks? We made a swift change in the fourth quarter of last year to get that side of the business under the control. Robert Straus Merriman, Curhan, Ford & Co. Great, okay and then for the last couple of quarters, we have obviously seen some asset sales, the store sales especially to the franchise locations or owners, what is your thought process going forward on that point. Gil Danielson We are still positive from operations and cash flow in the first six months. I think we will be cash flow some operations but I do not think it will be as much as that previously thought just mainly because the business had been strong and we are reselling the pipeline for merchandise. It looks like about a $65 million you said today in net inventory investment, is that right? This is a heavy collection business, either way you want to look at it and with collection/renewals efforts are good, the confidence to rent is better in the field on the office side of the game. We have created a lap out that was pretty sophisticated renewal system as we call it internally not a collection system but it was designed not to have paper and had a lot of bells and whistles have made without looking at a lot of activities which is really great and on paper erratically it surely have done well but when you do not run historical numbers you have to try to sit back and take note of what is different than what it was in the past. I know we change our head of real estate VP and we have been looking at the way we operate that and the different functions and so both in the whole office and the field so I think we are really retooling to go forward in this more methodical 10% to 12% growth versus in the last couple of years. Everything seems to have picked up in the second quarter, was that timing strictly matched with what happened with stimulus checks or was the strength before that and if there was strength in April, in May before the stimulus checks had, What was driving it because we know the consumer had a horrible quarter and gas prices were up and they are getting pinched on food and energy and everything so there has got to be an offset or there is going to be something helping, is it strictly stimulus checks or what did you put your fingers on? Gil Danielson We have got a lot of inventory here in the first six months and last year was a slow, what I assure was a slow year for us in some respects for our standards anyway. Arvind Bhatia Sterne, Agee & Leach And then one follow up to that is-are you guys seeing any anecdotal evidence that perhaps the credit constraints that we have in the economy today that might be actually helping you? I think we certainly been attempting good and we are purchasing a lot of merchandise to fill the pipeline and give product and from time to time reflect in the improving trend of the business so I do not know."
